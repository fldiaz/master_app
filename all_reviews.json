This time he's taken on for a job from a shady employer and he finds himself looking for a kidnapped wife as well as checking his back trail. Jack Reacher was alone, the way he liked it, soaking up the hot, electric New York City night, watching a man cross the street to a parked Mercedes and drive it away. The car contained one million dollars in ransom money because Edward Lane, the man who paid it, would do anything to get his family back. Lane runs a highly illegal soldiers-for-hire operation. He will use any tool to find his beautiful wife and child. And Jack Reacher is the best manhunter in the world. On the trail of vicious kidnappers, Reacher learns the chilling secrets of his employer\u2019s past . . . and of a horrific drama in the heart of a nasty little war. He knows that Edward Lane is hiding something. Something dirty. Something big. But Reacher also knows this: He\u2019s already in way too deep to stop now.

Armed and dangerous. Coming back.\nThis is what I call perfection.The Hard Way is my most favorite in Jack Reacher series so far. Just when I thought Lee Child's book couldn't possibly get any better, he has outdone himself once again with this unputdownable read! If I could, I would give it more than 5 stars.Who would have thought that just sitting and drinking coffee would get Jack Reacher involved in the investigation of the kidnapping for ransom of a woman and her child who remained missing although her husband already paid one million dollars in cash, exactly like he was told to do.On the trail of finding the kidnappers, the more Reacher dug into this case, the more dirty and vicious secrets were revealed. He discovered that all the clues and the pieces of the jigsaw which seemed to fit together just didn\u2019t lead him to the truth. On the contrary, those all led him to the wrong conclusion. However, for Reacher, he was even more than ready to do it the hard way.This tenth installment was a fantastic blend of suspense, mystery, thriller, and a slight touch of romance (aha!), all rolled into one amazing story where surprises seemed to lurk around every corner. I was not only impressed with the unpredictable plot but also the way the author kept me invested in the characters. The suspense and enormous tension were built up throughout the entire story which kept me on my toes, and of course, on the edge of my seat as well.And\u2026 nothing prepared me for this stunning plot twist I never saw coming! Seeing things finally unraveled (at breakneck speed) made my jaw drop in awe of this ex-military police. How could Reacher know?! With his intelligence, toughness, and capability, OMG, I couldn\u2019t admire this man more!If you\u2019re looking for a book with shocking revelations that keep you turning the pages faster than lightning, then pick up this one. You\u2019ll definitely get a great deal of enjoyment and excitement out of it!The Hard Way is not just a crime mystery/thriller.

In this, the tenth installment in the series, Reacher is enjoying a quiet cup of coffee, sitting at a table outside of the coffee shop in New York City. It's late at night and as Reacher is sitting there, a man gets into a car across the street and drives away.It's nothing out of the ordinary, but Reacher is a guy who notices things. and so when he's sitting in the same spot the next night and is approached by a man looking for information, Reacher is able to describe perfectly the man he saw for an instant twenty-four hours earlier. It's a remarkable ability, but then Reacher is a guy who also always knows exactly what time it is without wearing a watch.The guy who approaches Reacher convinces him to accompany him to the Dakota, the famous residential building where John Lennon once lived. There the guy introduces Reacher to his boss, Edward Lane, a very wealthy man who runs a group of \"security consultants.\" Lane explains that his wife and stepdaughter have been kidnapped. The ransom, a million dollars, was left in the trunk of the car that Reacher saw being driven away. Lane isn't worried so much about the money, but he would very much like to get his wife back, alive and unharmed.Of course Lane is not supposed to involve the cops and, as an ex-army investigator, Reacher has a skill set that Lane's other employees do not. Lane convinces Reacher to sign on and help get his wife back, offering Reacher a million dollars for a successful rescue.From there we're off and running, or rather, Reacher is, of course, while we sit back and enjoy the ride. It's a clever plot and Reacher is sometimes ahead of the game and at other times behind, but whichever the case, he's always fun to watch.

If you feel a certain affinity for the lone hero, a man of principle, of unwavering knowledge and assent as to his own actions, than Jack Reacher's your kinda guy. Lee Child has created an unforgettable and unique character in his creation of Jack Reacher. Jack seems to implicitly understand that he is a unique animal/human running around on this planet and that in spite of social conventions, cultural trappings, and whatever conventions and abstractions we allow into our mind in order to alleviate this core fact of our singularity (and aloneness)...the truth of it is not something Mr. Reacher denies.He embraces it. Understands his philosophy implicitly, revels in his physical being,his conventions and values. He defends those he loves, those he does allow into his world, with a loyalty bar none while never letting go of the notion that he is alone and being perfectly comfortable with that.I read one, and within two months read all 15 books with an appetite that couldn't get enough.Enough said,HR", "num_likes": 24, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["detective-mystery", "favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_id": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_title": "Por el camino dif\u00edcil", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2204508873", "review_id": "2204508873", "date": "Dec 30, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Rob", "user_url": "/user/show/57725883-rob", "text": "Number ten in the Jack Reacher series.Jack\u2019s enjoying a coffee and minding his own business, which is just the way he likes it.

These books are usually filled with mystery with a side dose of action, yet The Hard Way failed to deliver on these points. The mystery was obvious from very early on, and there were no real action scenes to enjoy. There were countless pages waiting for assumptions to be confirmed, which made it difficult for me to care about what was happening. Usually, Lee Child saves the book through a big action sequence at the end, yet this one fell flat and was over much quicker than usual.Perhaps The Hard Way was simply a blip, or maybe it was just my reading mood, but this one failed to give me what I usually enjoy about the Jack Reacher stories.", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_id": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_title": "Por el camino dif\u00edcil", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/45737097", "review_id": "45737097", "date": "Feb 08, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Toni Osborne", "user_url": "/user/show/1970656-toni-osborne", "text": "Jack Reacher, book 10Jack Reacher known as the best man-hunter in the world ends up helping Edward Lane, a well-paid mercenary, whose wife and stepdaughter have been kidnapped.

For me, it's always fascinating to watch Jack work his way through a mystery case, maybe detour on a wrong assumption or two, and then move full speed ahead as pieces click into place.

I do love how Reacher withheld and poked at Lane. How he pushed to get involved in the rescue of Kate and Jade. This man does not suffer fools! He already has a tendency to observe, calculate, and catalog and his years in the military police have provided him with a wealth of psychological field study of the worst of human nature. It's only sharpened his edge.Reacher is so incredibly observant---well, yeah, it helps that this is fiction and anyone can look brilliant when it merely takes a keystroke, let me enjoy my fantasies, will 'ya!?It always amazes me how the protagonist in a story can take a tiny bit of information and blow it up into an answer. Yeah, it takes time and a lotta effort. But s/he teases out that one little bit and keeps following the trail.Whoa, Reacher? Tense? Just reading the way Reacher thinks makes me consider how I observe life around me. Make me more aware of my surroundings. I'll never be a Reacher, but it does make life richer.Ooh, Reacher is wrong! Omigod. One for the record books. A lesson can be learned from how he reacts to it however. Instead of moaning and groaning and proffering up excuses, he ties a knot and moves on. Both Reacher and Kate want to use Lane's money to help the men and their families who were damaged or destroyed by Lane's actions, so, why did they leave the money behind??What a bunch of scum...I love what Reacher does to the bad guys at the end. And he ain't alone in it.The StoryEdward Lane's wife has been kidnapped. And he's in a panic. This has happened before. His first wife. Anne. He brought in the police. He paid the ransom. She was still murdered. He won't make that mistake again. Instead, he makes a worse one. He hires Reacher. He won't be needing that mirror on a stick...The CharactersJack Reacher is a drifter, a loner, and he likes it that way. Rarely staying in the same place two days in a row, he carries no luggage except a toothbrush in his shirt pocket. It's been seven years since he left the military. What he learned as an M.P. is still, however, with him.Edward Lane was a colonel in the army who retired under a cloud. He set himself up as the head of a band of mercenaries working under the radar for Uncle Sam. John Gregory is British, former SAS, and Lane's second-in-command. Carter Groom, Addison, Perez, Kowalski, and Burke are the rest of the A-team besides Graham Taylor, former SAS, who was her driver that day. They're sure he was murdered once they got the wife and kid off the streets.Knight and Clay Hobart are former A-team members. Until they got caught in a suspicious ambush in Africa. Dee Marie Graziano is Hobart's crusading, compassionate sister. Susan Jackson is Graham's sister. She's married to Tony and they have a daughter Melody; they work an organic farm up near Norwich in England.Kate is Lane's second wife and she has an eight-year-old daughter, Jade.Patricia Joseph was Anne's sister. She doesn't buy Lane's story. Detective Brewer is with the NYPD and is the recipient of her information and concerns. He in turn, passes her info on to Lauren Pauling, the FBI special agent who was in charge of Anne's kidnapping. She's now a private investigator.The CoverThe cover is awash in reds with a blast of yellow and green illuminating the tilted landscape.

Not as good as other Reacher books. Mostly solving a mystery. Not enough action. But it kept my interest.STORY BRIEF:Reacher is sitting in a coffee shop and observes a man enter a parked car and drive away. Reacher soon learns that this man was a kidnapper picking up ransom money. Lane\u2019s wife and daughter were kidnaped. Lane asks Reacher to help find them. Lane runs a group of military mercenaries for hire.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION:It\u2019s mostly police style investigating. Not enough smart things were being done, either by the bad guys or the good guys. The husband was wealthy and could have put tracking devices on the car, or had video/pictures taken near the car. There is almost no action until the end of the book. The best Reacher stories have been thrillers, with a bad guy plotting and trying to harm Reacher. This is not a thriller. It\u2019s mostly just solving the mystery with some action at the end. But because I like the character Reacher so much, I was ok with this. I didn\u2019t feel a need for it to be over.I noticed some reviewers complain that the phrase \u201cReacher said nothing\u201d is overused in these books. I disagree. He\u2019s the \u201csilent type.\u201d Studies have shown that most women use twice as many (or more) words per day than most men. In that sense, it fits. Reacher is not as talkative as others.I was disappointed that the author did not show one scene. A female does something stupid which allows the bad guys to capture her and others. We don\u2019t see how it happened. It was told, not shown. In one scene the good guys are safe in their house. In the next scene they are tied up in another location and being hurt by the bad guys.I had one other problem. I almost wish I had not read the book because one back story was too horrible for me. Two soldiers were captured and kept in an African prison for five years, with body amputations and repulsive living conditions. I\u2019ve read a lot of fiction with bad guys doing horrible things, but other books did not bother me the way this did. I\u2019m not sure why, but it kept me awake at night.THE SERIES:\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is book 10. I suggest reading the books in order, but not required.

A woman and her daughter have been kidnapped and Reacher is hired by the distraught husband to help bring them home at any cost.

But Lee Child puts it into the mouths, with absolutely no irony, of just about all his characters in this thriller; its repetition became so loathsome to me and G while we listened to this novel on our recent car trip to New Jersey that we\u2019d scream when we heard it. Maybe \u201cThe Hard Way\u201d isn\u2019t one of Child\u2019s most literary efforts, but I found his writing so heavily dependent on such clich\u00e9s and on the repetition, ad nauseam, of hardboiled-lite \u201csentences\u201d like \u201cReacher said nothing\u201d (definitely the prizewinner) that I can remember little else of the novel.

He has no need of permanent address or possessions, as he travels with only the (cheap) clothes on his back, a folding toothbrush, and a roll of cash in his pocket. He might know all about the various models of BMW but cell phones apparently symbolize the consumerism he eschews. His itinerate street smarts seem a great premise for a crime/adventure series, and clearly a lot of fans think so, but the writing gets in the way.

I liked the set-up, the plot twist was sufficiently gratifying, but the chase-and-mayhem section seemed almost formulaic, almost as if Child was working against a deadline.I think part of my frustration here was that - unlike many of the prior installments - Reacher knew too much about things that there was not necessarily any reason he'd know all about. (Why, for example, would Reacher be an expert on Manhattan geography and traffic patterns?) I've typically been pleased with Child for portraying Reacher's strengths as strengths but not over-reaching into the realm of the absurd - this time around, I found myself too often shaking my head and thinking, nah, that didn't make much sense.

He has no known ties to any person or place and never stays anywhere for very long. He performs the task at hand and then simply disappears until next time. I guess it's this drifter aspect that I like about the character. I am not a romantic as a rule, but there is enough romantic in me that I sometimes wish he would stay with a woman longer (his partner in this book would be a great choice) but then Reacher wouldn't be Reacher and that would be our loss in the end.I also like the way Jack reasons through the unknowns in the books and this one is no exception. Little details that most people might miss stay with him and sooner or later he assembles them into the solution. I truly enjoy how Child weaves these plots. I did more or less figure out the plot to this one but there were enough twists and turns to make me doubt myself. I gave this book five stars based on my own personal guidelines. If I can't put a book down for very long and will read it over other activities. The Hard Way fit those criteria, thus five stars.

hours, 2 minutesUnabridgedJack Reacher is just hanging out in a New York City coffee shop, drinking coffee and staring out the window when he gets caught up in a kidnapping case. Turns out he witnessed the money hand off without even realizing what he was seeing. The ransom payer tracked Reacher down, picked him up and brought him to his exclusive penthouse apartment/office. Turns out his wife and stepdaughter have been kidnapped and he has decided to leave the police out of it and just pay the ransom.The millionaire runs a quasi-legal mercenary operation and has decided to use his best men to search out the kidnappers and eliminate them...and he wants Reacher to help due to his previous police experience and offers him a hefty cash bounty if he produces. But, as Reacher starts to dig into why someone would want to kidnap his new employer's wife and stepdaughter he starts to find a lot more nagging questions than answers...This was an especially interesting Reacher book for me. Lots of action, about 3 surprise twists and a number of interesting locales. Dick Hill's narration is just about perfect. He totally captures Reacher's attitudes.

(My typical genre of choice is more in the YA department, while these books lean into action, suspense, and mystery. It's a series both my dad and I enjoy, so if that doesn't speak to its versatility, I don't know what does!) Ever since I read my first Jack Reacher book, I've always been excited to pick up another. And when I do, without fail, I can't put it down! Definitely a series I use to get out of my reading slumps and really enjoy. For this book specifically, I thought the premise was strong as always, and the characters were compelling as well. There were some minor twists that I predicted, but others I never saw coming. It was definitely a fun in-between to feel like I was in on the secret, but not too much that the book was predictable or boring. With this series, I would recommend starting out with the first book, but they all can read as stand-alones as well, although there are some details from previous books that later books draw on.

Lee Child seems to put in a good amount of research on military organization, missions, and weapons, so perhaps the military-themed Reacher novels are his favorites too. \"The Hard Way\" is one of the military-themed novels, with Reacher taking on a group of special operations soldiers from different services and nations and besting the best of them.Standard Reacher; happily, he stays more in character in this novel than in some others, and I noted Lee Child ending chapters with a new flourish: \"Reacher, walking alone\"; \"Reacher, armed and dangerous\"; \"Reacher, armed with a mirror on a stick.\" These one-liners effectively sum up chapters and despite their theatricality, I like.

He opened it up and used the same thumb to slide out a single card. He passed it across the table. It was a handsome item. Heavy linen stock, raised lettering, ink that still looked wet. At the top it said: Operational Security Consultants. \"OSC,\" Reacher said. \"Like the license plate.\" The British guy said nothing. Reacher smiled. \"You're security consultants and you got your car stolen? I can see how that could be embarrassing.\" The guy said, \"It's not the car we're worried about.\" Lower down on the business card was a name: John Gregory. Under the name was a subscript: British Army, Retired. Then a job title: Executive Vice President. \"How long have you been out?\" Reacher asked. \"Of the British Army?\" the guy called Gregory said. \"Seven years.\" \"Unit?\" \"SAS.\" 'You've still got the look.\" \"You too,\" Gregory said. \"How long have you been out?\" \"Seven years,\" Reacher said. \"Unit?\" \"U.S. Army CID, mostly.\" Gregory looked up. Interested. \"Investigator?\" \"Mostly.\" \"Rank?\" \"I don't remember,\" Reacher said. \"I've been a civilian seven years.\" \"Don't be shy,\" Gregory said. \"You were probably a lieutenant colonel at least.\" \"Major,\" Reacher said. \"That's as far as I got.\" \"Career problems?\" \"I had my share.\" \"You got a name?\" \"Most people do.\" \"What is it?\" \"Reacher.\" \"What are you doing now?\" \"I'm trying to get a quiet cup of coffee.\" \"You need work?\" \"No,\" Reacher said. \"I don't.\" \"I was a sergeant,\" Gregory said. Reacher nodded. \"I figured. SAS guys usually are. And you've got the look.\" \"So will you come with me and talk to Mr. Lane?\" \"I told you what I saw. You can pass it on.\"Gregory and Perez and Kowalski were asleep on sofas. Addison was awake but inert. Groom and Burke were drinking their coffee. \"I'm going out,\" Reacher said. \"Another walk?\" Burke asked, sourly. \"Breakfast,\" Reacher said.\"I probably got more people killed than you ever met. I don't beat myself up over them. Shit happens.\"\"And?\" \"He's not a very pleasant man. He's borderline mentally ill. He has a psychotic need to command.\" \"Patti Joseph says the same things.\" \"She's right.\" \"And you know what?\" Reacher said. \"His men are mostly a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic, too. They've got a psychotic need to be commanded. I've talked to some of them. They're civilians, but they're holding fast to their old military codes. Like security blankets. Even when they don't really enjoy the results.\" \"They're a weird bunch. All Special Forces and black ops, so naturally the Pentagon wasn't very forthcoming. But we noticed two things. Most of them had been around the block many, many times, but there were far fewer medals among them than you would normally expect to see. And most of them got general discharges. Not honourable discharges. Including Lane himself. What do you think all of that means?\" \"I suspect you know exactly what it means.\" \"I'd like to hear it from your professional perspective.\" \"It means they were bad guys. Either low-level and irritating, or bigger deals but with charges not proven.\" \"What about the lack of medals?\" \"Messy campaigns,\" Reacher said. \"Gratuitous collateral damage, looting, prisoner abuse. Maybe prisoners got shot. Maybe buildings got burned.\" \"And Lane himself?\" \"Ordered abuse or failed to prevent it. Or maybe participated in it. He told me he quit after the Gulf the first time around. I was there. There were pockets of badit was a simple kidnap, not an elaborate charade. And I blew it.\" \"How did you blow it?\" \"I don't know. I've lain awake a hundred nights going over it. I don't see how I made a mistake.\" \"So maybe you didn't blow it. Maybe it was an elaborate charade.\" \"What's on your mind, Reacher?\" He looked at her. \"Whatever it was, it's happening again,\" he said.\"So what are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to have to do it the hard way,\" Reacher said. \"What way is that?\" \"It's what we called it in the service when we didn't catch a break. When we actually had to work for a living. You know, start over at square one, re-examine everything, sweat the details, work the clues.\" \"Kate and Jade are probably already dead.\" \"Then I'll make someone pay.\"The tableau was the same as it had been nine hours earlier. Lane upright in his chair. Then Gregory, Groom, Burke, Perez, Addison, Kowalski, all silent, all morose, all arrayed here and there, eyes closed, eyes open, staring into space, breathing low. Medals not approved. General discharges. Bad guys.\"I don't have much for you,\" the guy said. \"Private-enterprise Americans fighting overseas are rightly considered to be very bad news, especially when they go fight in Africa. So this stuff is very compartmentalized and need-to-know and it was before my time, so I simply don't know very much about it. So all I can give you is what you can probably guess anyway\"I don't have much for you,\" the guy said. \"Private-enterprise Americans fighting overseas are rightly considered to be very bad news, especially when they go fight in Africa. So this stuff is very compartmentalized and need-to-know and it was before my time, so I simply don't know very much about it. So all I can give you is what you can probably guess anyway.\" \"Where was it?\" Reacher asked. \"I'm not even sure of that. Burkina Faso or Mali, I think. One of those small West African places. Frankly there are so many of them in trouble it's hard to keep track. It was the usual deal. Civil war. A scared government, a bunch of rebels ready to come out of the jungle. An unreliable military. So the government pays through the nose and buys what protection it can on the international market.\" \"Does one of those countries speak French?' \"As their official language? Both of them. Why?\" \"I saw some of the money. In plastic wrap printed in French. Banque Centrale, Central Bank.\" \"How much?\" \"More than you or I would earn in two lifetimes.\" \"U.S. dollars?\" Reacher nodded. \"Lots of them.\" \"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\" \"Did it work this time?\" \"No,\" the guy said. \"The story that did the rounds was that Edward Lane took the money and ran. Can't blame him for running, I guess. They were hopelessly outnumbered and strategically weak.\" \"But not everyone got out.\" The guy nodded. \"It seemed that way. But getting information out of those places is like trying to get a radio signal from the dark side of the moon. It's mostly silence and static. And when it isn't, it's faint and garbled. So usually we rely on the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. And eventually we got a solid report that two Americans had been captured. A year later we got names. It was Knight and Hobart.\"You didn't think about a rescue attempt?\" \"You're not listening,\" the guy said. \"The State Department can't admit that there are bunches of renegade American mercenaries running wild in Africa. And like I told you, the rebels became the new government. They're in charge now. We have to be nice to them. Because all those places have got stuff that we want. There's oil, and diamonds, and uranium. Alcoa needs tin and bauxite and copper. Halliburton wants to get in there and make a buck. Corporations from Texas want to get in there and run those same damn jails.\" \"Anything about what happened in the end?\" \"It's sketchy, but you can join the dots. One died in captivity,\"Talking won't help. I need to think.\" \"So think out loud. What doesn't fit? What's out of place? What surprised you in any way at all?\" \"The initial takedown. That doesn't work at all.\" \"What else?\" \"Everything. What surprises me is that I can't get anywhere with anything. There's either something wrong with me, or there's something wrong with this whole situation.\" \"That's too big,\" Pauling said. \"Start small. Name one thing that surprised you.\" \"Is this what you did? In the FBI? In your brainstorming sessions?\" \"Absolutely. Didn't you?\" \"I was an MP. I was lucky to find anyone with a brain to storm.\" \"Seriously. Name one thing that surprised you.\"\"I play the hand I'm dealt. No use whining about it.\"to lie from his deathbed.\" \"So what's the problem?\" \"There was no dying declaration. There were dozens of random fantasies spun over a four-year period. Hobart chose to back one of them, that's all. And he freely admits that both he and Knight were as good as insane most of the time. I'd be laughed out of court, literally.\" \"But you believed him.\" Pauling nodded. \"No question.\" \"So you can settle for half a loaf. Patti Joseph, too. I'll drop by and tell her.\" \"Would you be happy with half a loaf?\" \"I said you can split. Not me. I'm not quitting yet. My agenda is getting longer and longer by the minute.\" \"I'll stick with it, too.\" \"Your choice.\" \"I know. You want me to?\" Reacher looked at her. Answered honestly. \"Yes, I do.\" \"Then I will.\" \"Just don't get all scrupulous on me. This thing isn't going to be settled in any court of law with any dying declarations.\" \"How is it going to be settled?\" \"The first colonel I really fell out with, I shot him in the head. And so far I like Lane a lot less than that guy. That guy was practically a saint compared to Lane.\"\"So we're back at square one,\" he said. \"You know who it wasn't. Great job, Major. You're making real progress here.\" \"Not quite square one,\" Reacher said. \"How?\" \"I'm close,\" Reacher said. \"I'll give you the guy.\" \"When?\" \"When you give me the money.\" \"What money?\" \"You offered me a million bucks.\" \"To find my wife. It's too late now.\" \"OK,\" Reacher said. \"So I won't give you the guy. I'll give you a mirror on a stick instead.\" Lane said, \"Give me the guy.\" \"Then meet my price.\" \"You're that kind of a man?\" \"Only a bullshitter doesn't have a price.\" \"High price.\" \"I'm worth it.\" \"I could have it beaten out of you.\" \"You couldn't,\" Reacher said. He hadn't moved at all. He was sitting back on the sofa, relaxed, sprawled, arms resting easy along the back cushions, legs spread, six-five, two-fifty a picture of supreme physical self-confidence. \"You try that shit and I'll bend you over and I'll use Addison's head to hammer Perez up your ass like a nail.\" \"I don't like threats.\" \"This from the guy who said he'd have me blinded?\" \"I was upset.\" \"I was broke. I still am.\" Silence in the room. \"OK,\" Lane said. \"OK what?\" Reacher said. \"OK, a million bucks. When do I get the name?\" \"Tomorrow,\" Reacher said. Lane nodded. Turned away. Said to his men, \"Let's go.\" Addison said, \"I need the bathroom.\"\"Whatever, this is about the money, isn't it?\" \"Yes,\" Reacher said. \"It is.\" \"At least you might try to deny it.\" Reacher smiled and kept on walking. \"You ever seen a million dollars in cash?\" he asked. \"Ever held a million dollars in your hands? I did, today. It's a hell of a feeling. The weight, the density. The power. It felt warm. Like a little atom bomb.\" \"I'm sure it was very impressive.\" \"I wanted it, Pauling. I really did. And I can get it. I'm going to find the guy anyway.calm. Composed. Not surprised. But Reacher didn't expect him to be surprised. Surprise was for amateurs. And Taylor was a professional. A Special Forces veteran, and a smart and a capable one. Precious seconds spent being surprised were precious seconds wasted, and Taylor was spending the precious seconds exactly like he had been trained to: thinking, planning, revising tactics, reviewing options. \"My fault,\"He looked straight at Taylor. \"No,\" he answered. \"I guess I don't have a problem with that.

The man can't even sit in a cafe in Manhattan and enjoy his favorite drink- coffee- without a nasty crime needing his skill to solve and risking his life falling into his lap.For those who don't know him, Jack was born in a military family, looks NOTHING like pretty boy Tom Cruise (think Mickey Rourke in \"The Wrestler\" for what Jack looks like), and his whole family is now dead. He spent 13 years as a military policeman and investigator and has now been seeing the one country he never saw as a kid- his own USA. He carries nothing with him but a toothbrush, buys used clothes to wear a few days and throw away but keeps his teeth and body clean. He's quite the enigma but while he will kill a bad guy with no guilt, he has a heart for the downtrodden, kids, and women.So, here is java loving Jack making the mistake of returning to a cafe where he got good coffee the day before to have more. The night before he saw something rather odd- a mercedes parked illegally at a fire hydrant and a shifty man getting in it. Now another man shows up asking the waiter if anyone there had been there the night before and of course he points out our Jack.Jack soon finds himself at the exclusive Dakota building where John Lennon lived before he was murdered and obsessed with seeing John's widow Yoko. There is a safe with at least 30 million or so in cash in it and Lane, the owner of the apartment and the money, is an ex-military man who is now a for-hire mercenary with a whole pack of bad guys who left the American and British military under less than savory conditions. Lane's ex-model wife Kate has been kidnapped along with her little 8 year old girl Jade from a previous marriage and Taylor, the thug driving them to shop. Soon Lane offers Jack a cool million to find them. Oh and 5 years earlier, his first wife, ex-model Anne was kidnapped and killed the same way.There are many questions that come to Jack especially after he meets Anne's sister Patti Joseph who has been living across from the Dakota and spying on Lane and his men (making notes, taking photos) because she wants to prove that her sister was murdered by Lane for asking for a divorce and alimony, a NYPD cop who Patti feeds info to (a lonely guy who thinks she is sexy), the ex-FBI agent Lauren Pauling who the cop gives Patti's info to (she was the agent in charge of Anne's case and feels guilty she died), and one of the two men Lane left behind in Africa when on a mercenary jaunt. Hobarth lives with his sister and just got freed from Africa where they cut off a hand and foot each year for 4 years. Has Kate really been kidnapped or did she ask for a divorce and get murdered like Anne? Or did she run away? Was that body in the river Taylor or is he off somewhere? What about the other man- the one who killed Anne and was left in Africa along with Hobarth? Is he back alive for revenge? Of course Jack begins sleeping with Lauren. Lee Child has seen too many James Bond movies and he has Jack sleep with some woman in every book for no reason and with no idea of romance.

Well for starters, he\u2019s a six foot something ex-military policeman who knows his guns, ammo and the most effective places to punch people, AND quite attractive and incredibly buff, but mainly because he\u2019s a GODDAMN GENIUS. Sherlock Holmes has got nothing on Reacher\u2019s powers of deduction, let me tell you. Jack Reacher is the ultimate blend of brains and brawn.OK, I confess, I\u2019ve read all the Jack Reacher novels, and this is the latest. So I\u2019m a fan. Reacher left the army many years ago and kind of drifts around the US, solving all the problems which invariably and incredibly coincidentally drop in his lap.

It was a bit slow to get going, but by golly pretty soon I was hooked. Every so often when reading one of Reacher\u2019s adventures it crosses my mind that this is all a bit far-fetched (the start of this novel, for example), but usually I\u2019m enjoying the book too much to care. Maybe don\u2019t read several in a row though; the plot devices and even Reacher's own infallible geniusness start to wear a bit thin.Also I had a moment of unease near the end of the book where Lee Child writes that \u201c\u2026the remorse gene was missing from his DNA. Entirely.

Kate and Jade Lane have disappeared and Reacher's contracted by the distraught Mr. Edward Lane, but the more Reacher investigates, the more skeletons he finds in Lane's closets.Most people are just going to read the book, but for the few of us who love audiobook versions, be aware that there's a very long, very tedious, pretty much maddening section around disc 6 or 7 where Reacher and his female flavor of the book are interviewing a guy who's clearly had a few rough years. The performance is decent from an acting point of view, but the decision to include a heavy, ponderous speech flaw into an audiobook is downright baffling. It leaves you wondering what the heck the powers that be were thinking.Back to the story analysis ...My main problem with Running Blind (a.k.a. The Visitor) was that I didn't like any of the characters because they were all pretty much mean-spirited bullies, including Reacher. In The Hard Way, there are still bad guys and many people flawed enough to seem realistic, but at least Reacher's brand of vigilante justice actually seems like justice this go-round.The reader's perceptions are meant to flip several times in the book between who's good and who's evil. While the plot is way out there, the conclusion's satisfying. I give plot in most thrillers a pretty generous credibility excuse card.As with any book, there are some tedious sections and some over emphasis on making the title fit, but overall, I enjoyed this Reacher story much more than the others I've experienced of late.Conclusion: Although the 10th book in the series, I'd recommend this book as one of the stronger examples of what you're in store for in the series.

De man van Kate, Edward Lane, is het 'hoofd' van een klein particulier leger en zeven van zijn trouwste mannen zijn voortdurend bij hem en zijn vrouw.

Reacher may be a tough guy who knows how to beat people up and use a semi-automatic, but he's also incredibly intelligent, a top-notch investigator with Sherlock Holmes-like deductive skills. He can usually spot a plot twist long before the reader. In \"The Hard Way\", Reacher is, as always, in the wrong place at the wrong time (depending on how one looks at it, of course). Enjoying an espresso in a late-night cafe in New York City, Reacher witnesses a man get into a Mercedes. While it may seem innocuous and insignificant, Reacher quickly learns that it is anything but. Reacher is signed on to work as a free-lance investigator by Edward Lane, a wealthy man whose wife and daughter have been kidnapped. Reacher reluctantly takes on the job of finding and tracking the kidnappers, and his investigation soon uncovers many interesting facts about Lane. Such as the fact that his first wife was also kidnapped, seven years ago, ending in tragedy. Before one reaches the last page of this book, there will be dozens of plot twists that happen at break-neck speed. Readers will walk away with whiplash.

Reacher didn't know there was anything suspicious about what he had seen but he can recall everything in detail ... As others have remarked, it is an opening that takes some swallowing. Reacher fans who give the author the benefit of the doubt will press on; those who don't will miss being caught up in the pace and tension of Lee Child's spare, muscular prose. The choice is not easy to make. This is not the best Reacher book. After the iffy opening, it works well enough for threequarters of its length. Then the inevitable one-man-against-the odds successful resolution strains the credulity far more than the opening ever did, and the violence that is part of the Reacher persona becomes gratuitously gruesome. Addicts will cope; newcomers would be better directed to Killing Floor. In passing, it could be remarked that for a man with only one set of clothes, no apparent domicile and a tendency to disappear at the end of each encounter, Reacher has extraordinary success with women.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_id": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_title": "Por el camino dif\u00edcil", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/725716246", "review_id": "725716246", "date": "Sep 22, 2013", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Mike Nemeth", "user_url": "/user/show/5728783-mike-nemeth", "text": "In his 10th Jack Reacher novel, Lee Child again places his hero, the giant with frozen turkey-sized fists into a scenario in which he's arbitrarily selected to participate in an intense unfolding drama.

He unknowingly witnesses a ransom pickup as a man approaches a Mercedes parked out front, unlocks the car, gets in and drives off. Twenty-four hours later, back for another cup of coffee, he is approached by a man who explains what may have happened and asks him to follow him to the Dakota where he meets a group of mercenaries and their boss Edward Lane. Lane explains that his wife Kate and stepdaughter Jade have been kidnapped and he left the ransom payment as instructed by their abductors, in the Mercedes. Lane asks Reacher for a description of the man who drove the car away and when he discovers Reacher is ex-army and was once an MP, he offers him a million dollars to help him find the kidnapper. Now that the ransom has been picked up, Lane is expecting to hear where he can pick up Kate and Jade, but is still waiting for the call. When it comes the kidnapper demands an additional five million dollars and following that, another 4.5 million. Lane tells Reacher this is not the first kidnapping he has experienced. Five years ago his first wife Anne was taken. Lane called in the police and the FBI were involved and although he paid the ransom, she was brutally murdered. This time Lane does not want the police involved. He believes they made mistakes which led to her death, so he is determined to keep them out. But it appears history will repeat itself, as Lane waits for the phone to ring but it never does. Reacher agrees to help Lane, fearing for Anne and Jade\u2019s safety. Edward Lane is an ex-army colonel who owns Operational Security Consultants, a group made up of ex-Navy Seals, Green Berets, Army Rangers and British SAS men, all mercenaries for hire. Lane\u2019s company is contracted by governments in both America and foreign countries where they work under the radar, free from the supervision and oversight of others. There are always risks in this line of work, but the job pays well and both the mercenaries and Lane earn good money, one that affords them a very comfortable lifestyle. Reacher goes off on his own to do the work, wary of the men surrounding Lane and as he learns more, wary of Lane himself. He meets Patti Joseph, the sister of Lane\u2019s first wife Anne, who is convinced her sister was never kidnapped and that Lane had her murdered because she wanted to leave him. Joseph has an apartment across the street from the Dakota, has been watching him and photographing those entering and leaving the building. She passes the information to a man named Brewer, a New York cop who was part of the investigation into the first kidnapping. He in turn passes it on to Lauren Pauling, the FBI agent who worked the case. Pauling has retired and is now a licensed private investigator, but carries the burden of feeling she messed up the case and failed Anne; it has weighed heavily on her ever since. Reacher pairs up with Pauling and for the first time we see him with a woman who is ten years older than himself, but fearless and just as smart. They work effectively together and Pauling\u2019s contacts and access to data bases helps move their work forward. Reacher finds Pauling appealing. She shows him how older women have something different to offer their partners and he easily comes to agree with her thinking. What Reacher and Pauling discover about Edward Lane is not pretty. The man is an egotistical, violent psychopath who demands loyalty and cannot bear to have his orders disobeyed, whether it be his wives or his men. During their search for information, Pauling and Reacher uncover the details of a failed mission Lane led in Africa and what happened to two men he left behind when things went badly. What he learns about Lane makes Reacher hate him, but he keeps pushing forward, worried about Kate and Jade. This story emphasizes once again how observant Reacher is, noticing small details that would escape most other people. While working this investigation, Reacher has periods when he thinks things are off, but can\u2019t put his finger on exactly what that is and he ends up making some big mistakes. But it shows how quickly he can adapt without losing valuable time worrying about it; he just adjusts his plans and gets on with it. He also continues to demonstrate his vast knowledge of firearms. Not only does he seem to know and understand every gun available, he can work with them as well. Give Reacher a gun, any gun, and although it may not be the best gun for the job at hand, he can use it effectively. He is also a very logical thinker, continually going over various theories, considering possibilities and discounting those that don\u2019t fit the emerging facts. The first part of the book is all about the mystery surrounding the kidnapping, but the action soon shifts into high gear and ends in a violent confrontation in Britain. Child, faithful to the formula that works for him, ensures the bad man is so bad that readers only cheer Reacher on as he delivers his own brand of justice. The Reacher books are always about really bad guys, so bad that when Reacher hunts them down and delivers his violent revenge, it never has readers gasping, because readers feel he deserves whatever Reacher chooses to deliver. This is another strong addition to the series and although readers may figure out part of the mystery of the kidnappings, they usually don\u2019t get all of it, which is exactly what Child\u2019s style demands. He knows to give us enough to keep us reading, enough that we want to find out the parts we don\u2019t know or can\u2019t figure out on our own. And who can\u2019t love that whole bit about a \u201cmirror on a stick\u201d -- initially a taunt that proves to be a useful tool in a time of need.

Jack Reacher is this devil, a whirlingly destructive creature, without gravitas. Or, actually , soul. Yes I accept, that one can hardly find, in the entire corpus of the work, a single sentence worthy of independent admiration. But put them together, one by one and page by page, and I am consumed, not by admiration exactly, but by something much more powerful-- the desire, the rage, to know what is going to happen.In this crime fiction, it all began with someone opening a car door and driving off. Reacher witnesses this innocuous event, paying it little attention while spending time in New York City. When called upon to answer questions about the man he saw, Reacher soon realizes that he may have witnessed part of an elaborate ransom payment. A woman and her daughter have been kidnapped and Reacher is hired by the distraught husband to help bring them home at any cost. While working with his temporary employer, he soon learns of the man\u2019s sordid and criminal past, which may play a role in the larger kidnapping rationale. The further he digs, the less Reacher thinks of this as a simple swap of money for live bodies.Reacher, almost like in his every other book, applies some combination of tactical brilliance and brute force. The utmost pleasure is in Reacher\u2019s moment of introspection in the millisecond before the action occurs: his silent consideration of the variables of physics, geometry, and psychology that comprise a violent encounter. Just working out the sequence and the angles is a tour de force of split-second calculation.Love for Reacher is an awkward, weird sort of love. When I am rooting for Reacher I am well aware of the fact that Lee Child has now written more than twenty Jack Reacher novels, this being the tenth in the series. In each, Reacher kills roughly a dozen people\u2014which means, if you do the math, that he\u2019s murdered somewhere north of two hundred people in the course of his lifetime in fiction. All with a fair amount of forethought and deliberation and more than a little relish\u2014he is, technically speaking, a serial killer. He\u2019s not pointing toward a more civilized tomorrow. He\u2019s leading us back into the wilderness, with the reassurance that our psychopaths are bigger and stronger than the bad guys\u2019 psychopaths. He's my hero of lawless fantasy: a world where the institutions of civility would melt away and all we would be left with was a hard-muscled, rangy guy who could do all the necessary calculations in his head to insure that the bad guy got what he had coming.This tenth installment is a fantastic blend of suspense, mystery, thriller, and a slight touch of romance, all rolled into one amazing story where surprises seem to lurk around every corner. What makes this book extremely interesting is not only the unpredictable plot but also the way the author keeps readers invested in the characters. The suspense and enormous tension are built up throughout the entire story which are sure to keep the readers on their toes, and of course, on the edge of their seats, as well.The prose is clear and concise all through, no place for ambiguity. The writing style is a little odd with short sentences, mostly just stating the facts.If you\u2019re looking for a book with shocking revelations that keep you turning the pages faster than lightning, then pick up this one.

Working the clues, examining the evidence, as I think Reacher is fond of saying. That's all very well...But...what is\u00a0it and Lee Child and British people's teeth, for fuck's sake?! Lee Child is - or was, he may have changed now - English and presumably still has English teeth. OK, we don't look like the bleeding\u00a0Osmonds, but then who wants to? British\u00a0teeth are, in my experience, no better, no worse than American people's teeth. Given the portion\u00a0sizes\u00a0- and arse sizes\u00a0- over there and the amount of fast food Americans eat, I'd venture that English teeth are more likely to me markedly\u00a0better than US teeth. But, and maybe because Child has\u00a0taken US citizenship and there is a clause\u00a0therein that says you must take on board the teeth cliche (you probably have to call English\u00a0people Limeys as well), Mr Child labours (with a fucking U) the point, again and again. And again. That's what kept it off a five from me. Unnecessarily repeating a false cliche. He's probably\u00a0after a job in Trump's government (I use the word 'govern' in its\u00a0most shambolic sense, obviously).Other \u00a0than that...it's very good. Hangs together very well indeed. I do like that Reacher gets absolutely\u00a0nowhere for most of the book. Obviously, there are a few clues scattered here and there and - and only because I tried to do it - I managed to figure it out before the reveal, which at least made me feel good. Lee Child has cut back on the filler again, as I've noted before, it's still a satisfying getting your money's worth size, but there's not a lot of wastage. The writing style can be a little mechanical at times, but the improvement over the first two or three, is noticeable.\u00a0There are whole sentences nowadays, for instance. They could even film this one as well, I'd say, the stuff about the private army and that, would go down very well these days (even though this is now 11 years old). Maybe that's what's good about Reacher, what appeals, he is timeless. There is technology in the story, Reacher is largely aware of it, but\u00a0he has pretty much chosen not to be either aware of it, or use it. So, brain-power and working the clues will never date him. Maybe that is what has taken Reacher to such a wide audience. The hook of the first few books, of Reacher being able to beat just about anyone up he wanted to, when necessary, has been absent for a while now (though there was a bit last time out), so it's all about plot and Reacher's brain-power these days.The best Book Blog on the web: Speesh ReadsThe best Facebook Page: Speesh Reads", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["thriller", "crime"]}, {"book_id_title": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_id": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_title": "Por el camino dif\u00edcil", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3491715897", "review_id": "3491715897", "date": "Nov 01, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lilanthi", "user_url": "/user/show/28033066-lilanthi", "text": "Jack Reacher, known as the best man-hunter in the world, ex MP, 5\u2019 6\u201d tall, yet able to blend in a crowd and look anonymous, gifted with amazing analytical skills and able to take appropriate defensive or offensive action in a matter of seconds\u2026, able to observe and capture tons of information at the blink of an eye \u2026 is relaxing in a restaurant enjoying his coffee, when he observes a man approach a car parked near a fire hydrant, and drive away.The next day, he sits at the same place, at the same time, and notices a man, in a suit, with an obvious military air about him, inquiring something and the waiter , nods toward Reacher.The man approached Reacher, who knows this can only be about the car that was driven away.He reluctantly agrees to meet the man\u2019s boss Edward Lane, who has a special interest in what he saw the previous evening.Lane, also ex military, is the head of a company of security consultants who are actually Mercenary Soldiers.

Lane offers a million dollars to Reacher, and assigns him the task of rescuing his wife.As he begins his mission, the first person he encounters on the streets is Lane\u2019s previous wife Anne\u2019s sister, Patty. Patty informs Reacher that her sister Anne, was kidnapped several years ago and had died tragically as a result. She blamed Lane for the fate that befell her sister, and had taken up vigil in an apartment across from Lane\u2019s residence, to watch his every move, hoping that some day she would find proof of her accusations.

For example, he is *not* writing good prose. In fact he\u2019s struggling for merely adequate prose. Boring and often irrelevant description, punctuated by uninspiring dialogue from an invincible protagonist and a supporting cast of thoroughly two-dimensional characters. Admittedly the villain is OK, but it is safe to say that \u201ccreating compelling characters\u201d is another thing Lee Child is generally not doing.This isn\u2019t snobbishness. I've read some great crime thrillers that were exceptionally well-written \u2013 I read Jane Harper's \u2018The Lost Man\u2019 last year, and it was excellent. This isn't. I\u2019ve read four or five of these books now, and they never get any better.Except\u2026 I keep buying them. I keep reading them. I blasted through this one in about 2 days (although that\u2019s made easier, admittedly, by the fact that my eyes tend to glaze over the moment he gets the urge to describe anything). So I\u2019m trying to work out what it is that he\u2019s doing. And I think I\u2019ve figured it out.He keeps the right questions.I couldn\u2019t put \u2018The Hard Way\u2019 down, not because I was swept up in things or because I was enamoured with the book, but because Mr Child kept asking questions I had to know the answers to. Are the wife and daughter alive? What happened to Anne? Who is this woman mysteriously observing everything from a window? Why is ten-and-a-half million a significant number? Every page, he would sucker me in with another one, question after question after question, mystery after mystery, and the only way to guarantee the answer was to get to the end.And, more importantly, the answer was worth getting to! Admittedly not *every* question raised was answered totally satisfactorily \u2013 I\u2019ve heard that Mr Child writes without a plan, and there were some definite moments of false conclusion that would be explained by that \u2013 but overall, it paid off. I got to the end and felt like it had been worth suffering through the pedestrian writing because, ultimately, the story worked.So although it pains me, although I spent half my reading time grimacing and the other half rolling my eyes, I have to give this three stars because, fundamentally, I enjoyed it. In the hands of a more competent wordsmith it could have been excellent; as it is, it was an extremely satisfying palate cleanser, and I\u2019ll no doubt read more of Lee Child\u2019s books in the future.So\u2026 well played, Mr Child!", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["archive"]}, {"book_id_title": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_id": "22637349-por-el-camino", "book_title": "Por el camino dif\u00edcil", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4226589266", "review_id": "4226589266", "date": "Jun 14, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Darryle B.", "user_url": "/user/show/96701599-darryle-b", "text": "Like any Jack Reacher novel, there's Reacher sitting at a diner minding his own business but is always observant our his surroundings and watching people. That's because his years of training as an ex-Army investigator compels him to do so and old habits die hard. This time he finds himself in Times Square outside at a diner. He observes a man walking and entering a double parked vehicle and drives away. Other than the vehicle being double parked, it doesn't appear to be anything unusual about that situation that stands out. That is until Reacher goes to that same diner the next day and is approached by a man who inquires of him as a potential witness to what he observed about the man entering the vehicle. This man wishes for Reacher to meet his employer who is asking Reacher to merely tell what he saw for a substantial amount of money. Upon meeting with the man's employer, Reacher is introduced and it is apparent that the employer is former military and is now serving as a civilian contractor for the military. After realizing that Reacher's background as an ex-Army investigator may be an asset to him as a result of a kidnapping plot of his wife and kids, he offers to hire Reacher to look into the case and investigate. Reacher is not the one to take anything at face value and doesn't believe in coincidences. Early on, he realizes that there are a lot of things about this current situation and the employer's past history that doesn't quite add up. Reacher is not one to let up until he gets to the bottom of the situation, especially when it comes to investigating a case. As I have said many times before, this is a complex case that only a brilliant investigator like Reacher could uncover to find the truth. He is thorough, he looks a variety of theories and scenarios to see how they make sense and fit. In this case, if he is not careful it could cost him his life and the lives of the kidnapped if he does not discover the truth about this case. The only way in which he is able to save the lives of those involved in this case, stop the bad guys from prevailing and live to tell about it is to do it the Reacher way which is THE HARD WAY. I highly recommend this book as it is a well written and another notch of fine storytelling by famed novelist Lee Child.

The writing and plotting are both pretty taut, though there were a few unnecessary words here and there. I don't know what it is with this genre and sentence fragments (almost always it's a missing subject), but I guess that it's used for pacing/tension?The setup was decent, though these books work less well when the author and protagonist seem behind the times. Not knowing about text messages in 2007? Please. The \"twist\" is pretty obvious from about a third or halfway in, but that doesn't make it bad.The biggest gripe for me was the \"Skyfall\"-esque stand in an old English farmhouse. The action up to that point had mostly been believable (except for Reacher going for \"walks\" repeatedly without causing a massive amount of suspicion from the mercs), but by the end it was a bit too much. The scene in the pub near the end was just too ridiculous - one MP vs 3 Special Forces vets, and it's over in 3 swings of a poker? Their skills may have been a bit rusty, but at least one of them could have drawn his weapon in the time it took to swing the poker between target one and two, lol. Similarly, in the barn, the \"split second\" hesitation of one baddie gives Reacher enough time to receive a verbal instruction to \"shoot him\" *and* two nods from two different people? Please. The author pays pretty close attention to many details, but I felt by this point it was all a little too hammy. The antagonist sticking his head out of the barn doors was too pat, as were his henchmen just being left in the pub without so much as a word in retaliation. Speaking of which: if, as one of the minor characters put it, those skills were \"99%\" the result of training, how can Reacher best all these guys when he never appears to train? Overall, a fun and fast read, but not much more than that.

Which involves Jack Reacher to travel to England & places the author back on home soil & gives a nod of the head to a huge amount of English fans Lee Childs has. That said it appears that Reacher is no fan of England, seeing it as dirty & cramped, And the author can't resist a pop at English dentistry, despite WHO, Facts that show Americans have the worst teeth in the civilized world. Maybe the author is guilty of throwing to many opinions into the story, maybe that's why it just doesn't sit well? Fans will lap it up, Or I'd imagine they already have.

And this was the 23rd work by Lee Child in the Jack Reacher universe I have read in about 20 weeks. I have been pacing myself and trying to stick to just one a week. This is the 16th novel I have read, I have also read Jack Reacher's Rules, the No Middle Name, short stories collection and all of the other crossover and standalone short stories I could find. I freely admit I really prefer the UK cover to the North American, I like the silhouette of Reacher on the side of the road, in the subway, with a skyline backdrop seem to fit better for me. But I keep reviewing the Reacher stories because honestly you could start with any of them. I started with the 23rd published and have been jumping around since I read that first one. I was hooked. This Reacher novel was in many ways different than most of the ones I have read! Even after 23 stories their is a lot to find out about Reacher and how he does things. What I loved about this one, was that Reacher could tell something was off, for a long time. But he could not put his finger on it. So part of the story is his struggling along trying to find the missing piece. And not having the resources he formerly had, it needs to be done the hard way. With going over the details, and some gumshoe work. In this one Reacher witnesses something. And soon a former SAS guy wants to talk him to his boss for a personal report. Reacher is offered a significant hunk of coin to find a kidnapped wife and child. And soon that offer quadruples. But something just does feel right to Reacher, but he keeps pushing forward because of the woman and her daughter. Edward Lane is former military and he runs what he markets as an elite group of soldiers for hire. They have been all over the world. And the list of possible enemies is long and scary.But Reacher wants to get the woman and her child back safely. And if that is not possible, then he will make them pay. Once he finally figures out what has been nagging at the back of his brain, it might be too late to prevent disaster.But to find out what that is you will need to read this Reacher novel.

There is (of course) more to the kidnapping than first meets the eye, and I particularly liked how Jack Reacher on many occasions was using clues that had been presented to the reader to get closer to the solution. In this way, this book was similar to a typical crime novel, where clever reasoning and keen observations lead the investigator further.At the same time, there was enough action and suspense to qualify this as a real thriller. The final shoot-out is particularly pulse-raising, but there were several other good passages in the book that keeps you at the edge of your seat.

Acting out of \"reflex and professional curiosity\" (and the promise of a generous fee), Reacher agrees to help sinister ex-army officer Edward Lane, whose posse of six Special Forces veterans are even more ominous than he, track down his kidnapped daughter and trophy wife. Since the kidnapping of wife number one five years earlier ended in her death, Lane cautions Reacher that he will not brook police interference (\"You break your word, I'll put your eyes out\"). From Lane's quarters in the West Side's venerable Dakota apartment building to the shady sections of SoHo and Greenwich Village, the author's atmospheric descriptions make Manhattan a leading player, with menace lurking at every intersection. The inevitable showdown, on a farm outside a tiny English village, ranks as one of Child's most thrilling finales.

And then, the whole world rushed in. Disbelief came first, then surprise. Then the full scope of the ending struck me with a pang of bewildered anger, that this unexpected and extraordinarily horrid thing should happen only for the story to just... stop. So, as I said, what the hell. \u2014 The first book in Leigh Bardugo\u2019s Nikolai Duology, King of Scars, picks up three years after the ending of Ruin and Rising, and catapults us into a world beginning to collapse.The Ravkan Civil war is over and the Triumvirate have successfully forestalled carnage, at least for a while. For, against all hope, Ravka is mostly intact, and still theirs. Nikolai Lantsov, king of Ravka, wants nothing but to let the past fade, to push past the ugliness of age-old hates and soul-warping fears and start a new era. Even thoughts of the Darkling and his terrible revenge become lost beneath the placing of one foot before the other.But with his people being stolen from within his very borders and devious forces conspiring against him, Nikolai is too wary for triumph, and aware at every moment how quickly it could all go wrong. Soon, a grimmer reality gains its hold, yawning at Nikolai's feet: Nikolai didn\u2019t realize how deep the Darkling\u2019s power had gone inside him, didn\u2019t realized that it is still inside him, coiled up, ready to lash out in violence and rage. No matter what they did, the Triumvirate couldn\u2019t uproot the howling demon from his soul. Instead, they held it like a secret between them, and it burned like fire.Terrified by Ravka\u2019s precariousness, its slender breath, the Triumvirate settle into the certainty that if they hope to save their country...they must save their king first.Periodically, a threat is brewing inside of Fjerda and Nina Zenik, now a Ravkan soldier, is sent to investigate it. With home behind and an uncharted future looming out of the fog, too distant to see clearly, but coming closer all the same, Nina is taunted with phantoms of the beloved dead. But if she wants to save her country, she must let the ache of grief and anger lay muted in the back of her mind. Some ghosts, however, are harder to silence. \n\u201cThis country gets you in the end, brother. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d\u201cNot us,\u201d he said. But Dominik was already gone. \u201cI\u2019ll do better,\u201d Nikolai promised, just as he had so many years ago in Mitkin\u2019s classroom. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\nPersonally, I thought King of Scars was absolutely superb.Unlike the Six of Crows duology, King of Scars is a tale told on a much less heroic scale. The plot comes late, but it comes naturally and readily. I love how we gradually come to notice the various strings Bardugo is pulling through the frame, the dispersed fragments slowly assembling into a picture; the anticipation kept me completely riveted.But even more than the developing mosaic of Bardugo\u2019s world, the intensely escalating threat level, and the quiet slicing of the understated prose, what really pushes King of Scars from very good to really great are the deep undercurrents. It\u2019s the attention and care that Bardugo pours into her characters\u2014into their failures, their successes, their actions in the face of hideous trauma, and their reactions to threat, conflict and uncertainty\u2014that truly pays off. It\u2019s Bardugo\u2019s inerrant talent for allowing her reader to breathe vivid life into her characters through laying open their minds for the reader; the sense that the characters are being stripped down to their essence, revealed in all their glassy fragility, their unbearable vulnerability. King of Scars is mostly told from three different perspectives: Nikolai's, Zoya's and Nina's. And I want to talk about each one of them.\nWhy did it matter to him what became of Ravka? Broken, needy, frustrating Ravka. The grand lady. The crying child. The drowning man who would drag you under rather than be saved. This country that took so much and gave nothing back. Maybe because he knew that he and his country were the same.\nLet\u2019s start with Nikolai Lantsov. Nikolai is an intensely fascinating character. A prince who had clawed his way into being king, but whose throne is built on a lie, on a foundation of quicksand. A bastard who wears his family name, not a gold-lined cloak of entitlement but, as a lead-lined mantle of responsibility. A man who, for so long, had hung onto a single filament of purpose: to serve his country, and that purpose had been like a rope thrown into a churning sea, saving him from drowning. And lately, a noose around his neck. King of Scars asks a most intriguing question: what happens to such a man in a version of the world in which he suddenly becomes hero and monster in one?The answer is more complicated. From his appearance in the S&B series, Nikolai had a way of wearing everything on the inside, showing no hint of anything but exuberant charm on the outside. He wore many guises\u2014\u201cthe obedient son, the feckless rogue, the able soldier, the confident politician\u201d \u2014and he himself would tell you to trust none of them. Those who mistook Nikolai for anything but a finely-honed weapon were fools of their own breed. With his truths and with his lies, Nikolai always managed to draw so many stubborn wills into his purpose as though he were winding up a thread. And in this book, it was interesting to note how Nikolai never granted himself leniency on that account, or any other: Nikolai resents his endless ambition and despises his self-serving streak, and he will be the first to tell you that it is \u201cthe height of arrogance\u201d to imagine that Ravka\u2019s survival depends on his rule. In so many ways, King of Scars is the story of Nikolai confronting the worst aspects of himself, both figuratively and in an unsettlingly literal sort of way. Used to his own unthinking endurance, Nikolai now has to contend with the weakness. In this book, we see past the charming royal to the scarred king, exhausted beyond measure, fighting against the windmills of adversity in a battle he keeps insisting to fight alone. We see the man who might have filled the place at the center of himself with the answer to who he was since he\u2019d become king, but who had lost everything else. We see Nikolai Lantsov\u2014really see him\u2014past his arsenal of horrors to the dark, terrible thing sheltered inside him. There was something so startlingly recognizable about Nikolai\u2019s inner battles that I was still turning over and over in my head when my best friend\u2014with whom I read this book\u2014called it \u201ca lowkey metaphor for depression\u201d, and a light bulb went up in my mind. I realized then that the only difference is that Nikolai\u2019s darkness took the shape of a demon, flame-eyed and huge. A monster Nikolai do nothing but make war with\u2014war with this inexplicable thing, war with this monstrosity seething within him. Nothing less but war. Every single day.Chapter 30, in particular, held my heart paralyzed within my chest. We read as Nikolai engages in a conversation with the demon that\u2019s taken hold inside him, and there was this moment when he knew, with sudden, stark clarity, that the vicious words the monster hurled at him did not come from it; they came from him, from Nikolai\u2019s own innermost self, guilt-poisoned, anxiety-tortured, and fear-ravaged. The fear that had been with Nikolai ever since he had words to put around it: that he would never be enough, that he would fail, that the country he loved without respite would never love him back, that he was nothing more than a leftover piece of something broken. It was incredibly emotional to witness as Nikolai\u2019s thoughts curved and rose, slowly widening, until Nikolai, emboldened by the simple realization that \u201c\nhe would never, ever turn his back on a wounded man\u2014even if that man was him\n\u201d, finds the strength to not dissolve into the terrible weight of the voice inside his head. That line still strikes such a deep chord inside me. That single truth, bruised and flayed and freely given, contains immeasurable solace, and is, I believe, at the core of Nikolai\u2019s character.\nNikolai had always understood that he and Ravka were the same. He just hadn\u2019t understood how: He was not the crying child or even the drowning man. He was the forever soldier, eternally at war, unable to ever lay down his arms and heal.\nBardugo also doesn\u2019t shy away from the equally wounding realities of those who have been hurt and abused by the Darkling, amongst whom is Zoya. Zoya was a weapon in the Darkling\u2019s grip, a tool of vengeance, and a sop to his pride. She, like many others, was as clay in his hands, to be shaped into the obedient form he desired, and the Darkling, like all abusers, had particularly relished destroying all her faculties for trust and love until they were so tangled with shame and hatred and guilt that she hardly knew one from the other. But Zoya survived her abuser, but just when she thought she could finally commence the process of healing, a wretched reality comes at her an avalanche: the Darkling's followers built a monument to his crimes\u2014the crimes Zoya had been made to endure\u2014and declared him a saintly, misunderstood soul. His violence was rewarded with exultation, with remembrance, while Zoya\u2019s suffering was met with cold indifference. \"Who would speak for Liliyana, for Genya and Alina and Baghra if she did not? Who will speak for me?\" Zoya chillingly asks at one point. This clever, illuminating contrast between the girl we meet\u2014and not entirely warm up to\u2014in The Grisha Trilogy, and the woman Zoya becomes in the wake of tragedy, is heartbreaking too. So were careful distances Zoya kept from herself and the rest of world. From herself and Nikolai. Zoya offers a very interesting counterpart to Nikolai\u2019s character. Both of them kept their minds captive at the surface, only very rarely allowing it to venture into the lightless depths. But even when their innermost thoughts stayed hidden from each other, Zoya and Nikolai still noticed the weight of the secrets the other carried, even if they couldn\u2019t discern the shapes of them\u2014and I lived for those fragile moments between them, full of aching and fear-laced unspoken longings and distances between two people who were hurting in open sight of each other instead of with each other. Finally, no review of this book will be completely without a mention of the queen of my heart: Nina Zenik. First of all, Crooked Kingdom\u2019s ending still brings the taste of tears to my mouth, and King of Scars returned me to the sharp, wounding angles of that pain within the first few pages. Nina Zenik is still the same Nina\u2014and she isn\u2019t. She is still the fiercely, defiantly alive Nina whose heart always beat on the edge. The girl who tears a whole into the wall when she can\u2019t find the key. But if you\u2019d met Nina in Six of Crows, you\u2019d notice how the sunnier parts of her were still painfully lodged in the creases of her first heartbreak, and I couldn\u2019t dislodge from my mind the idea that even the softest-hearted people can become quite dangerous when you destroy the things they hold dearest. Nina has been through so much, and from those leftover shreds of her, the little pile of griefs and gaping absences, poured forth an ocean\u2019s worth of fury and poison-tipped sorrow. Everything Nina did in this book, she did through a haze of trauma, and I cried so much reading Nina\u2019s grief-soaked chapters, so utterly tortured by reminders of her loss, that I sometimes had to stop and put a merciful distance between myself and the pages just so I can breathe. The only solace I could find was in her interactions with a ~certain~ someone and the momentous thing slowly taking shape between them, which left me with a stirring of hope in my chest.A hope that I\u2019m tightly clutching in my fist as I (impatiently) wait for the sequel...

(Spoilers are hidden within a spoiler tag)Hello all, and meet my ghost, who is currently writing this review.First of all, I think there will be plenty of people who are not thrilled with the end, but I am LIVING for it (and I'll list my reasons at the bottom of this review under the spoiler tag). However - I did have some issues (like the pacing), and I'll talk about them below, but overall, Queen Leigh is so freaking brilliant. I am in utter and complete shock. I had to reread the last chunk about 10 times before the ending sunk in. I screamed my throat raw, scared my cat, and practically passed out.First of all, an absolute massive standing ovation to Lauren Fortgang, who narrated this book on audio and blessed me with her talent. I absolutely 10000% recommend the audio version \u2013 and this goes for the original trilogy too (which she also narrated). The audiobooks are outstanding. (Yes I am unhealthily obsessed and Lauren, if you read this, I am... sorry.)That also leads me to my next point \u2013 you DEFINITELY need to read the original trilogy (Shadow and Bone) before reading this \u2013 which is legit one of my all time favorite series. I also recommend reading Six of Crows because a main character (and massive spoilers) are in this book for her. Basically, please read through all the Grishaverse books. You won\u2019t regret it, and if you don\u2019t, you will be spoiled for all of them.Alright, back to this barely coherent review.I love everything about my precious son Nikolai, and like always, he is absolute perfection. I've been BEGGING for this book for the longest time. But I definitely had some issues with parts of the book \u2013 mostly about certain plot points that had me scratching my head a bit. Some parts were slow. Now that I\u2019m finished, I think some of those bits are growing on me, but I gotta say (sadly) that I found myself a bit bored at times (more below). But listen. Leigh is my favorite author. I freaking adore everything she writes. Her worldbuilding is absolutely astounding, and her characters are just\u2026 I can\u2019t. I love them. So that, paired with the ENDING THAT KILLED ME, is the reason I am rating this five stars. Queen Leigh deserves nothing less. I admire her endlessly. I think I'll enjoy this even more the second time around, especially now that I know what she was building towards.\n\n\u201cOne risks looking less like a monarch and more like a hostage.\u201d \u201cYou have emissaries to manage these matters of state,\u201d Zoya had argued, \u201cambassadors, underlings.\u201d \u201cThe public may forget how handsome I am.\u201d\n\nLet's break it down.Nina. This is where I had a hard time. I love her, I REALLY do \u2013 so much. She\u2019s hysterical and super relatable, not to mention, a great role model for girls. She's the friend I wish I had growing up. But I found myself dozing off during her chapters. I\u2019m not going to say much since we\u2019re right at the release, but she\u2019s away from Nikolai + co on some mission in Fjerda, and it seemed to drag and drag. I was so excited to see her interact with my crew (Genya, David, Zoya, etc) but alas, she\u2019s occupied. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she has some great moments \u2013 and some teary ones for sure, especially if you know the ending of Crooked Kingdom (she\u2019s still dealing with this). But I just didn\u2019t love her chapters. That being said, I\u2019m 1000% stoked to see the moments I craved in the sequel.Nikolai.My golden son. I said it above, but he\u2019s perfection. He\u2019s witty, clever, smart-mouthed in the best way, and all around charming as usual. Belt up those pants, friends, otherwise he\u2019ll charm them right off. If you\u2019ve followed his story, you know what happened to him in R&R, so obviously he\u2019s dealing with that \u2013 as a major plot point of this book. (Queue Britt sobbing into her tea.) What made me the most sad, though, was for a book titled King of Scars, I feel like we didn\u2019t get ENOUGH of him. He didn\u2019t have that many POV chapters - and it felt like Zoya's book tbh. But even still, he\u2019s a freaking badass, and always manages to steal the show. The two-clever fox. I knew this, and he STILL shocked me out of my seat more than once. And the end? *bites fist* *zips lips before I explode* Ahhhghghghgh. (more on this lower)Zoya. I like her, but I haven\u2019t fallen in love with her. I will say this though \u2013 she grew on me a lot, and Leigh wrote her character arc beautifully. In fact, that's the focus of her chapters - we find out so much more about her past and what really went on from her perspective during the Grisha Trilogy. All that, and she had some truly fantastic moments. I loved the banter between her and Nikolai. Now, I know some of you are wondering about the ships so I\u2019m going to post my thoughts in the spoiler tag. (view spoiler)[ Alright, so yes, she and Niko are flirting a good chunk of the book. I knew this going in, but I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. It feels a TAD forced. But listen, Leigh has never disappointed me before (and this book certainly isn\u2019t all about me, she can write what she wants) \u2013 so I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind. Basically I just want our dearest King to be happy. He deserves it so much.  (hide spoiler)]The plot.Ahhhhhh so yes. I have so many mixed feelings! But again, I freaking love Leigh, and I\u2019m not going to get overly critical here. But this kiiiinda felt like a prologue book. I mentioned I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Nina\u2019s chapters. I actually really enjoyed Zoya + Nik\u2019s POVs \u2013 though at around half-way, things got real weird and I was suddenly questioning if I was reading the same book. Things change course super fast and the plot takes a nose-dive in another direction and I was like??? What is happening??? - I\u2019ll add more once the book has been out for a while, but for now, I\u2019ll just say this: Parts of it, I LOOOOVED, and other parts, I\u2019m still totally confused and frazzled about.But then.But then.But then.The ending.Hot damn can Leigh write a killer ending \u2013 and oooooooooo boy did she go where I never thought she\u2019d go. Let me tell you right now \u2013 we\u2019re going to have SO many people that hate this. I'm calling it - people are going to complain, and I'm going to have to try hard not to roll my eyes - because I freaking LOOOOVED it (and not for reasons you might expect). If you think about it, which I have - a lot - it's freaking brilliant. I\u2019ll expand more once the book has been out for a while, but holy hell I am so here for this. The next book \u2013 oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.I am.Still screaming.My throat.Is raw.Alright, friends. Want to know my reasoning for loving the end? Here it is (warning - it's very long):(view spoiler)[So I feel like the Darkling is easily one of the best villains in YA literature - and most iconic - even if you don\u2019t ship him with Alina or feel his pull. He\u2019s well fleshed out and equally as terrifying \u2013 and not to mention, wildly popular. He's Leigh's best creation in the villain department - and I really doubt she\u2019d top him, no matter what villain she came up with next. I think she realized this.The Darkling had so many unexplored facets to him. So instead of trying to outdo herself - when that was unlikely - she chose to capitalize on him by doing the one thing no one would ever expect (and easily the riskiest thing she could have done) - which was to bring him back. This allows her to delve way deeper into him - but also show him in a completely new light: Fractured. Imprisoned.One reason he was such a loved villain was because however monstrous, his cause was genuine. He wanted to stop the persecution of his people (Grisha) - and he worked his entire life to do it. He never got to see them free, even after years of sacrifice (years that eventually turned him entirely cold and ruthless). As Alina discovered - there was a simple boy underneath the demon - one who wanted his people to be free, and one who didn\u2019t want to be alone. Perhaps in this, he\u2019ll at the very least see the rise of his people. But don\u2019t get me wrong - this will come at a cost. I don\u2019t think Leigh will redeem him - that was clear when Zoya and Genya came face to face with him. He isn\u2019t getting a \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card.I think the biggest complaint is that people feel like it voids out the original series ending. But I disagree. Alina stopped him from taking over her/her body as well as basically the entire world. She prevented him from becoming all powerful - and using her. Her arc was complete. The Shadow Fold and volcra are gone. Ravka is no longer split in half. Nikolai is King. The 3 amplifiers are gone - destroyed. The Darkling will never be what he once was - or what he hoped to become.And the thing is - he didn\u2019t just come back. He isn\u2019t his old powerful self anymore. This is perhaps the best and most significant part of his return. He came back under Nikolai\u2019s watch. Nikolai is essentially wrangling the Darkling\u2019s power (or the fraction he has left) to win a war - which is brilliant. We aren\u2019t going to watch the Darkling try to take over the world again. This isn't The Grisha Trilogy reborn. Instead, we\u2019re going to see Nikolai, the two-clever fox, control his ass. (Imagine the sass and banter that will ensue.) But don\u2019t get me wrong. I fully expect to see some power struggles in the best possible way.Lastly, my theory is that by doing this, we\u2019re going to get to see the full extent of merzost \u2013 which was an unfinished exploration from the original series. I bet we\u2019ll even see Morozova himself. Grisha magic and merzost was what set her world apart - and she\u2019s constantly tugged and pulled at her own theories (woven into the fabric of the world/light vs dark). Without the Darkling, without his lingering power, this diminishes.

It\u2019s how we survive each day. We pretend the pain isn\u2019t there, that we are made of scars instead of wounds.\u201d\n\nOh friends, it has been a long while since I read the concluding events in Ruin and Rising! Honestly? I probably really would have benefited from doing a reread. Yet, I will be the first to admit that I was complete Darkling trash back in the day, and I have grown a lot as a person and realized that he is someone that shouldn\u2019t be romanticized, but I was so damn hyped for this story and to see how the people of Ravka are doing after that final battle and living under a brand new king. And I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I was truly let down. Also, I want to emphasize that a three star rating isn\u2019t a bad rating! I still enjoyed this and I loved seeing some of the character that I love with my whole heart and soul, and also falling in love with a new character, too! But this was just so ungodly slow for the first half, which is something I\u2019ve never felt while reading anything by Leigh before. I know that we had a lot of be caught up on, but I just couldn\u2019t immerse myself into the world or story until after the halfway point. I really recommend that you don\u2019t read King of Scars (or this review, honestly) if you have not read all the other books in the Grishaverse! But as a quick recap before I get into my thoughts and feelings: People are still fearful of Grisha and are capturing and killing them regularly. Grisha are also still becoming addicted to jurda parem, and many different variations of it, which enhances their powers but at a cost. \n\n\u201cThe books do not tell the whole story\u201d\n\nAnd this story is told in many points of views, but there are pretty much only three locations that this story takes place, until they will (hopefully) all weave back together! Zoya and Nikolai are off with a new character trying to discover what lives inside Nikolai. Meanwhile, back at the palace, family friends are teaching a young boy how to impersonate Nikolai himself, so no one will know that he is away! And then we have Nina off on a completely new mission, where she finds out so much about herself and what is happening to Grishas in areas that are still living in fear of them.But this is a story about grief and loss and how living with those two things can impact your life beyond words. This is a story about being the person everyone wants you to be, while ultimately choosing the person you truly are. This is a story about feeling like your life is predicted for you, but realizing that you are capable of doing any and everything you want. \n\n\u201cCall me Grisha. Call me zowa. Call me death, if you like.\u201d\n\n\u27bd  Zoya Nazyalensky  - One of the strongest Grishas ever (Squaller, of the Etherealki Order) and is an incredible fighter and leader. She was also the Darkling\u2019s favorite, but is now my favorite. \u27bd Genya Safin - My second favorite character! Genya, as the Darkling's gift, used to be the servant to the Queen, and was treated so very terribly. She is much happier now, but still is living with the torture that the Darkling inflicted upon her. \u27bd David Kostyk - A very skilled Fabrikator who helped make things to hold amplifiers. \u27bd Tolya Yul-Bataar & Tamar Kir-Bataar - Twin Grishas who own my heart. \u27bd Isaak - The common boy solider who is impersonating Nikolai while he is away! (I fell so in love with this new character so easily, truly!) \u27bd Nina Zenik - Heartrender (of the Corporalki order) who used to be a part of the Dregs in Six of Crows! Now on a top secret mission, that is about to be jeopardized because of new information! Also, she is on a mission for herself to finally lay someone to rest at home. \u27bd Hanne - Fjerdan who Nina meets and instantly feels connected with. Hanne is just trying to live in a world where every opportunity has been taken from her because she is a daughter and not a son. \u27bd Leoni & Adrik - both are Grishas who are accompanying Nina on her new mission! \u27bd Yuri - A monk who is with Nikolai and Zoya, who is also one of the leaders of Cult of the Starless, who worship the Darkling. \u27bd  Nikolai Lantsov  - The current King of Ravka, who is expected to marry and produce an heir because so many foes are looking to overtake him. But he is dealing with the torture that the Darkling has left in his body. \n\n\u201cA handsome monster husband who put a crown on her head? It\u2019s a perfect fairy tale to sell to some starry-eyed girl. She can lock you in at night and kiss you sweetly in the morning, and Ravka will be secure.\u201d\n\nNikolai\u2019s monster is something that no one really knows how to control, but he is constantly being drawn to The Shadow Fold, which was the breeding ground of unspeakable shadow horrors and where the Darkling harnessed so very much of his immense power. We are also introduced to three new characters that I\u2019m not going to really talk about because of spoilers, but they were amazing. I loved learning more about amplifiers, since there are so few people who have had them in this world and seeing the power that they bring is pretty intense and such a cool development in this story. Again, without saying too much, I loved all the scenes involving The Fold. \n\n\u201cWe are all connected, King Nikolai. The Grisha, the Fold, the power inside you. The Fold is a wound that may never heal. But perhaps it was not meant to.\u201d\n\nBut chapter twenty-five is the best chapter in this entire book, and that\u2019s because Zoya is the best character in this book. Like, I get that it is called King of Scars, but this book was way more about Zoya and her beautiful story and everything that she has overcome than Nikolai\u2019s. Especially since this book also spends half of the time focusing on Nina and what she is up to on her mission, I just feel like this is not Nikolai's book; it was half Zoya\u2019s and half Nina\u2019s. Which is fine, I\u2019m not saying I disliked that, I just feel like it was a weird flex because going in you expect it to be all things Nikolai and it really couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Plus, it really doesn\u2019t feel like his character progressed all that much either, where Zoya and Nina both had tremendously big events happen that will alter their future and the very future of Ravka. Okay, but now I\u2019m going to say the thing that\u2019s probably going to make you all dislike this review, but I don\u2019t really ship Nikolai and Zoya together. Like, I think the story would have been way more powerful if they were just friends. But this weird romance is laced throughout the story, even though there is no confirmation or reward or actual romance, it just felt weird to read. Especially with that annoying ending. I don\u2019t know, I just really don\u2019t ship them together, yet, but I probably will eventually. And I totally would have shipped them if we would have gotten more of them actually starting a romance instead of us just being like, \u201cokay, yeah, this is totally the direction that Leigh is leading us!\u201d Plus, that ending? I really don't want another unnecessary love triangle. And I want this review to be spoiler free, so I\u2019m not going to go into details, but you\u2019re either going to love or hate the ending. And, friends, I for sure hated it. One of my favorite things in literature is when a spin-off series comes out, and the overarching threat is the ramifications of the what happened to that book\u2019s conclusion and/or villain. Having a cult that views the Darkling as a saint and worships him? That was the setup of my dreams, friends. And the ending just felt like such a cop-out and made me so angry and it really left such a disappointing taste in my mouth. \n\n\u201cAll fuels burn differently. Some faster, some hotter. Hate is one kind of fuel. But hate that began as devotion? That makes for another kind of flame.\u201d\n\nOverall, I just didn\u2019t love this the way that I truly anticipated that I would! Maybe I hyped it too much? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have reread The Wicked King right before starting this? Maybe I\u2019m just being salty over the Darkling? I don\u2019t know, friends, but this let me down. I am highly anticipating what will come with the next book, and I hope to have a much higher rating and happier review! Also, Ninth House is going to be everything and I still cannot wait for that 2019 release!

I'm not sure if I'm being harsh or generous, honestly. It wasn't a bad book. Bardugo keeps growing as a writer and she especially shines with her dialogue. I liked the characters and relationship dynamics; I loved the funny, snarky conversations; I just felt like this book was so slow in parts. 500 pages is on the heftier side for a YA book, and I felt the drag of most of them.Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom are great books, in my opinion. I love the heisting and shenanigans. I think they're really tightly-plotted and I can 100% understand what I'm reading for. Here, the plot meandered. Nikolai's efforts to rid himself of his monster seemed to get lost somewhere, and Nina's mission to find grisha felt open-ended and directionless (it reminded me of Mare's journey in Glass Sword, which I really disliked).There's a real lack of focus for a lot of this book. Romance is minimal, which is usually a good thing, but here it might have added a much-needed hook. I didn't feel like either Nikolai's or Nina's stories provided a significant conflict or mystery until the very end. I was also bored by Isaak's chapters.I started King of Scars on such a high, convinced I would love it. 100 pages in I made a note saying \"not much has happened\". 200 pages in I made another note saying \"lots of Grishaverse recap and flashbacks; little plot progression\". It's a very long time until the story really goes anywhere.This all sounds really negative, but it was saved somewhat by how much I enjoy this world and the characters. Zoya is especially interesting. Unlike some, I quite liked the ending, and I'm intrigued by the possible romantic directions the sequels could take. If only this book didn't feel like one very long prologue.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "num_likes": 978, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2019", "fantasy", "young-adult", "coverly-love"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2377744074", "review_id": "2377744074", "date": "Apr 30, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "NickReads", "user_url": "/user/show/34369915-nickreads", "text": "tea got spilled facts got spokenwe're all shook now", "num_likes": 1163, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2135553279", "review_id": "2135553279", "date": "Sep 26, 2017", "rating": 2, "user_name": "emma", "user_url": "/user/show/32879029-emma", "text": "The more time that passes...the more I realize that I did not and do not care about this book.I was excited for it, for no real reason. Not only did I not finish the Grisha trilogy, I DNFed the second book (one of maybe 7 times I have ever ever done that in my whole life). I actually could not even force myself through it.I had a passing interest in Nikolai, but that\u2019s mostly because everyone on the internet screams about him and there are VERY few things I love more than jumping on a bandwagon. I wanna be one of the cool kids, you guys!!! Let me sit at the popular table!! I can be into the same things you\u2019re into!!!Here\u2019s the issue. The thing that makes Nikolai a good character in the Grisha trilogy is his sassy side-character energy. He doesn\u2019t have to have a real Serious Character Development Arc, because he\u2019s there to be fun and snarky and a royal roguish pirate. (What a combination. So good on paper.)But then you give him a whole duology and we have to careee about his internal monologueeee. We have to want to know how he feels and why and what Tragic Thing In His Past That Is Always Dad-Related is making him act the way he is.I don\u2019t care about why sassy side characters are sassy. I just need the sass to propel me through a five hundred page high fantasy plotline I only sparingly care about.That\u2019s the issue with this whole book. It\u2019s an elaborate plot that takes about 250 pages or so to find itself and figure out what the hell is going on, and then it gets weirder and more confusing but no more interesting or fast-paced. It\u2019s like 500 pages of world building for a world we already know. It is difficult to care about this. It is even more difficult when you do not care about a single one of the characters.I have high standards for Leigh Bardugo characters. Maybe that isn\u2019t fair. I definitely didn\u2019t give two sh*ts about a single person in the whole Grisha-trilogy Grishaverse, and in fact craved a brutal death for each and every one of them so I could a) be rescued from the crushing monotony of their bratty thoughts and feelings and b) actually be interested due to there being a single action-packed or exciting moment. But I DID love Six of Crows. Oh, god, did I love that gang. Well really I loved like three of them, which is approximately a 50% success rate, which is a failing grade. But for ME, that\u2019s an A++++. Because never do I ever like three characters in one book.However.I didn\u2019t like any of them in this one, so.There are like a million characters in this book who are given traits and characterization, by which I mean maybe 10 or 15, but they all still feel so boring. None of them are my cup of tea. If any of them fell off a cliff at any given point in this book or the next, my reaction would be \u201cOkay. Fine.\u201d Not even mild surprise. Just acceptance.Because, to reiterate, I did not care about this book, I did not care about its plot, and I did not care about a single character.And yes, I\u2019ll read the next book.Bottom line: I D O N \u2019 T C A R E.But I\u2019ll try to.----------------pre-reviewthis book has left me a shell of the person i used to be.review to come / 2.5 stars----------------currently-reading updatesyes i am reading this book and no i haven't read the grisha trilogy. it's called living on the edge you should try it sometime----------------tbr reviewme: yeah nikolai is ok i guess but the grisha books are garb\u00e0geleigh bardugo: *announces nikolai duology*me instantly: ", "num_likes": 553, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "owned", "ya", "couldn-t-wait-to-read", "unpopular-opinion", "reviewed", "i-love-these-characters", "diverse", "2-and-a-half-stars", "eh"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2135456739", "review_id": "2135456739", "date": "Feb 18, 2019", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Hailey (Hailey in Bookland)", "user_url": "/user/show/21937982-hailey-hailey-in-bookland", "text": "Maybe a 4.5*?

Though Nikolai might not like it, those things were all a part of him still. Like calls to like.\"\nFair Warning this review is going to have a million quotes because this book was written SO BEAUTIFULLY and Leigh ... please lend me an OUNCE of your talent I think anyone who is in the YA book community knows just how big a deal this book getting announced was. Every single update on Goodreads was people adding or talking about it, twitter was going off and speculation and theory videos kept on popping up as more and more info got announced. I was 100% a part of this hype. Crooked Kingdom was one of the best books I ever read, and that entire duology owns my heart. I also actually really enjoyed The Grisha Trilogy, for its political intrigue, expansive world, and interesting character who still inspire debate in the community even now. Needless to say, I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book for quite some time. And it kind of failed to live up to my expectations? But it also way surpassed them in some regards?King of Scars splits perspective between three main characters \u2013 Zoya, Nina and Nikolai. (There is also other perspectives, but I cannot say much without spoiling). We follow each after the events of Crooked Kingdom. Nikolai and Zoya are trying to protect Ravka from threat from their bordering nations, and rally the Grisha to support their country. Nina is living in Fjerda, under the kings orders to find and protect Grisha, but also to fulfil her promise to Matthias to bury him back in his homeland.For me, the first part of King of Scars was much stronger than the second. The focus on politics in the first half was something I really enjoyed. It had the same feel as Grisha, but on a more international scale. I enjoyed that Bardugo kept up the intricacies of international politics established in Six of Crows, but brought back original trilogy influences, such as the power the church has within state affairs, and Nikolai\u2019s precarious position as ruler due to his family lineage. The political games and Nikolai trying to control the trajectory of Ravka, when faced with great outside threat, was easily my favourite aspect of this book. If you enjoyed the original trilogy for its political intrigue I think you will definitely like this.Nina\u2019s chapters in this were my favourites, which I am shocked is apparently an unpopular opinion. I don\u2019t want to say too much because you can\u2019t without getting into the spoilery realms, but her role and what she was up to, especially in the second half, WAS THE BEST. In Six of Crows, Nina talks a lot about being a soldier and a nationalist and her love for Ravka and I think we saw that here. I want even more in book 2.\n\u201cCall me Grisha. Call me zowa. Call me death, if you like.\u201d\nLets talk about characters! I actually really enjoyed all three perspectives here. Nina, as mentioned, was a joy, and while she wasn\u2019t one of my favourite perspectives in Six of Crows, she really won me over in this.Nikolai and Zoya were both enjoyable too. I have seen criticism that this book didn\u2019t have Nikolai in it that much and I don\u2019t agree? I think he was in it quite a bit, although his perspectives were perhaps the weakest. Although he was fun to follow, and I love him so much, AND HE IS STYLISH AND FUNNY AS EVER, I also felt we learnt a lot about him. His character was definitely given a depth that wasn't there before, and I think his inner turmoil regarding Ravka, and how he came to identify with Ravka as a solider constntly at war, was a really interesting development for him. And definitely added a complexity to his character and his role as a king. But even though I did enjoy his arc overall, and I loved following him, but it didn\u2019t hit as hard for me as Nina and Zoya\u2019s perspective. I think Zoya especially just had such a strong voice in this, and it definitely seemed to overshadow Nikolai at times. Despite that, I'm not mad about it at all. I think Zoya has such a strong narrative in this book it doesn\u2019t matter if Nikolai\u2019s fell down a little. She was one of my favourite Grisha characters and I found her backstory really interesting. It was so nice to have her perspective on the Civil War and to see her relationship with Nikolai. Although I really like Nikolai, I was more interested in getting back in this world then seeing him particularly, so for me this book still worked though if you\u2019re a die hard Nikolai fan, I can see why it might not as much.There was also some romance things going on which \u2026 I am going to talk about those more in my discussion.\n \"Who would speak for Liliyana, for Genya and Alina and Baghra if she did not? Who will speak for me?\"\nOne final thing want to mention, that I LOVED, before we get into some issues was the theming and discussions around agency and what makes a villain. King of Scars looks a lot at the repercussions of war, and how The Darkling impacted each characters life. The focus on how the state and states at war treat women as expendable, and how each characters trauma is dismissed was something I really enjoyed. Zoya\u2019s quest to reclaim and hold on to her agency, and Nina\u2019s quest to give voice to victims was something I REALLY LOVED and haven\u2019t seen many people talk about much!\n\u201cLay down the thorn, boy king. Haven\u2019t you earned a bit of rest? Aren\u2019t you tired?'He was. Saints, he was. He thought he had grown used to his scars, but he had never grasped how much of his will it would take to hide them. He had fought and sacrificed and bled. He had gone long days without rest and long nights without comfort. All for Ravka, all for an ideal he would never attain and a country that would never care.\u201d \nOkay lets get into the issues \u2013 which for me was the plot pretty much the entire way through part two (excluding Nina\u2019s chapters) I just .. didn\u2019t like it. For me the plot became kind of too outlandish, and I felt the ending was definitely rushed. The careful set up, and the way Leigh Bardugo had seemed to plot things out with precision really fell apart for me. I found everything that happened with the world a bit too wacky. I also .. HATED .. the ending. I cannot say what happened without spoiling, but it is one of my most hated tropes ever and I am SICK of books doing it. So while I felt I should have been more excited for the sequel, now I\u2019m kinda just worried. I also think the ending does such a disservice to some of her previous works. I am going to go much more into depth on this in my discussion, so stay tuned!Overall, King of Scars definitely delivered what I was looking for in the majority of the book. It was so nice to get back into the Grisha world and catch up with these characters who we haven\u2019t really seen in a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed Nina\u2019s plot, and the focus on dealing with the consequences of the civil war that destroyed Ravka. Leigh Bardugo is a really strong YA fantasy author, and I think I will always enjoy her works. However, part two did fall apart a bit for me, and the ending was .. something I hate. So that definitely detracted from the enjoyment for me. Overall, though, I found this extremely enjoyable, and had all the hallmarks of a Bardugo book I love: strong characters, great worldbuilding, excellent political intrigue and lush writing that sucks me right into the world.\n\u201cShe wished she had Inej\u2019s gift for spywork or Kaz\u2019s gift for scheming, but she only seemed to have Jesper\u2019s gift for bad decisions.\u201d \nOH, AND ON THAT NOTE, EVERY SIX OF CROWS REFERENCE HAD MY HEART GROWING FIVE SIZES!!!", "num_likes": 527, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2019-reads", "young-adult", "owned-books", "2021-reads", "favourite-covers", "reread", "fantasy", "bi-mc", "series", "fave-couple"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2135445517", "review_id": "2135445517", "date": "Sep 26, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Natalie Monroe", "user_url": "/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "text": "\n\u201cLesser animals whined and struggled when they\u2019d been caught in a snare.

(Y U do this to me every time, BD? I thought we were tight.)Just a note: this book is not very accessible to readers new to the Grishaverse. I guarantee you\u2019ll be confused. Six of Crows was accessible because it featured a new location and entirely new characters. King of Scars has lots of references to previous series.If I had to sum up King of Scars in a single-word, it would be meandering. Six of Crows is superb, suspenseful tight plotting. King of Scars feels underconceptualized, as if Bardugo simply wanted to write a book about Nikolai, but didn't have enough meat for a fully realized plot. Nikolai's chapters were actually underwhelming. The humor I fell in love with back in the original trilogy didn't land nearly as well, and his character arc, though satisfying, seems typical and one-note. With that being said, I did enjoy learning more about his past. We see him grow from idolizing Vasily to realizing his brother is not the king Ravka needs. He befriends a common soldier on the front and that shapes him into the kind, witty privateer Alina meets. It is Zoya who really steals the show. I maintain she was originally was meant to be a two-dimensional Mean Girl, but Bardugo does a fine job in adding depth to her character without making it appear forced. Her petty cruelty in Shadow & Bone is explained by her being young and arrogant and a desire to test her beauty on men. We all do stupid things when we're teenagers. Coming back to Zoya a few years later feels right, like rereading your old fanfiction bio (*shudders*) and comparing it to the person you are now. We also get a more concrete reason for why Zoya abandoned the Darkling to side with Alina back. Her character arc is beautiful and far more potent than Nikolai's imo.Nina's a bit of an outlier here. She's deep undercover in Fjerda with Adrik and Leoni (the Grisha girl Jesper's mom saved). She's still grieving for Matthias and I admit I slightly teared up when Nina finally lays his body to rest. My main complaint is that her primary character development is letting Matthias go and we already knew that was going to happen at the end of Crooked Kingdom. Most of what happens during her chapters is simply a long extension of stuff that seems given with minimum surprises. There's a fourth POV character called Isaak too. I won't say too much about his role in the book except I enjoyed his storyline the most next to Zoya\u2019s. (view spoiler)[I\u2019m a sucker for court politics. (hide spoiler)]The ending was infuriating. That's all I'll say.I'll still read the sequel, of course, because it seems like all the pieces have finally moved into place by the end and we'll get finally get that sweet, sweet Six of Crows-esqe action.

You can watch it burn a thousand times and still it will return.\u201dDo you remember holding this book in your hands for the first time, trying not to ruin the glossy golden cover with your unworthy, smudgy fingers while you're shaking from anticipation?Well, I do. Which is why it surprised me that it took me a few chapters until I started enjoying myself. But when I did, it was a glorious experience. I was captivated by the political games, the intrigues, the miracles and mysteries of the Grishaverse. I enjoyed Zoya's and Nikolai's banter, but my favourite chapters were definitely Nina's. Her journey through the north and her mission to uncover the dark secrets of that little Fjerdan town kept me on my toes. It felt like one of those spy novels where the protagonist is left alone in a wintery and bitter cold alpine region, only to discover that some monstrous war machine is secretly being developed in a hollow mountain. I loved every second of it. It felt dangerous and exciting.Overall, the writing style, plot twist and world building are on such a high level that I couldn't not give 5 stars. But that doesn't mean that this book was flawless. There are a few things that bothered me and the first one is one of my most hated tropes - spoilers ahead:1. Reviving the already defeated - and killed! - antagonist. I mean, how would you feel if Voldemort suddenly returned? Or how DID you feel when Harry's scar started itching again in Cursed Child? (Not that Cursed Child is anything but fanfiction. I refuse to see it as a sequel.)It's a cheap trick. It's lazy. You couldn't create a better enemy so you just take the dead guy and give him a new wardrobe. Not with me. What makes it even cheaper is that it's the obvious and lazy thing to do. Honestly, I don't understand why you all swoon over the Darkling, and I'm sure you love that he's back, but Leigh, you can do better than that.2. There is too much going on. Part II of the books was filled to the brink with magic and plot twist. And it was just a tiny bit too much for me to be entirely realistic. On the one hand, because of what I said in 1., on the other hand, because if there is so much that you cannot see coming, it loses its credibility. So when that female Saint whose name I already forgot turned out to be the big baddie I didn't buy it. And when Zoya and that other Saint whose name I also forgot \"killed\" each other to create a new amplifier, it seemed somewhat overdramatic.3. Initially, I didn't even think of this criticism, but when a friend mentioned to me that he wonders why the book is called King of Scars when Zoya's and Nina's POV overshadow Nikolai's, I couldn't help but agree. Moreover, Nikolai's chapters seem somewhat...unneccesary compared to Zoya's. While Nina is somewhere in Fjerda, Nikolai and Zoya are almost always in the same place at the same time, basically telling the same story.Now that I got that off my chest, let me just say that I am really looking forward to the sequel. I would love to find out more about the Shu and their kingdom. I also just want to see Jarl Brum destroyed once and for all. And I cannot wait for the title and cover reveal.

Bardugo continues her pattern of endearing characters and sharp dialogue.

I've come to love this world, and all characters in it, which makes it impossible to make an objective review anymore. How could one not be biased? You have some of the best characters from both S&B and SoC, and inherits Bardugo's beautiful writing style while maintaining connections to S&B and SoC.\u201cSpeak, Nazyalensky. When you purse your lips like that, you look like you\u2019ve made love to a lemon.\u201d\"Do shut up, Your Highness.\u201dFor the first time in Grishaverse, the story proceeds along two seemingly independent plot lines. On one hand, we have Nikolai and Zoya continuing along what I thought the King of Scars was all about, while Nina is moving along her her own journey with Adrik and Leoni. Both plot-lines are quite entertaining. Nina's part of the story shared some similarity to SoC - a lot of mystery and only a little magic, while Zoya and Nikolai's adventure is the complete opposite. Though Nikolai's part was certainly more eventful (not to mention having two POVs), I liked the Nina's one better, which was full of mystery. For the first half of the book they were equally matched, but what followed for Nikolai and Zoya afterwards wasn't something I was particularly fond of. It wasn't bad or boring or anything, but it did feel like a cartoon for a while. In the first part, Nina's character was full of sorrow, which was to be expected given how Crooked Kingdom ended. Though it was disheartening, it felt complete at last, being able to give a proper goodbye to Matthias. I would've preferred to see another POV from Nina's side as it felt a little unbalanced at times.\"Do that thing you do where you use too many words to say something simple and confuse the issue.\u201dIf you're new to this universe, it's best not to start with KoS. But chances are, you've read at least one of S&B or SoC previously, which would also mean that majority of the readers are probably in love with the character already. And they only get better, and complicated here. Nikolai and Nina used to be my favorites, but Zoya kind of surpassed them both in KoS: If you didn't like her before, KoS is going to change that. We get to know what is behind that steel exterior, and even understand the reasons behind her actions in Ruin & Rising. If her character was lacking in any way by the end of S&B trilogy, Bardugo does more than enough here to make her one of the best characters in Grishaverse. I wondered - more than once - whether this story was more about Zoya, instead of Nikolai.\"if you loved a thing, the work was never done.\"When compared to S&B, everything from writing to world building to character building had improved significantly. However, for me, Kerch with Kaz and the gang was still superior. But overall, this is a nicely balanced story with plenty of mystery, humor, suspense, politics, magic, and contains more than enough twists. May be there's not much romance, but I've got no complaints about that.\u201cIt\u2019s not exciting if nothing can go wrong.\u201dBut the highlight of the book was stolen by that flabbergasting ending. Well, I did not see that one coming! It was like the author changed her mind during the last two pages, and decided to drop a nuclear bomb. I mean, come on... The unforgiving cliffhanger notwithstanding, it didn't make much sense. Had the ending been a little more satisfying, I would've rounded up what should've been a 4.5-stars to 5! But the good thing is, I already have The Rule of Wolves with me, and if history is any indication, Bardugo never fails to deliver the best ending possible in the last book of a series.\n\n\"Little red bird, let me go.\" - \"Goodbye, Matthias.\"\n\n", "num_likes": 467, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2694615030", "review_id": "2694615030", "date": "Jan 29, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "user_url": "/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "text": "Reread 2021Okay, wait!!!

A. MOOD!!! *lol* The entire book is nothing but bad news and well, yeah this is Ravka. There\u2019s always more bad news to come. XD Leigh didn\u2019t just nail it with those words; she also set the pace for this doulogy! To be honest I had no idea this was going to be a doulogy and after finishing \u201cKing of Scars\u201d I have absolutely no clue how she wants to wrap this all up. There are so many things that need to be addressed and the mere idea of facing them all in the next book is already making me look like a copy of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d. (Which is one of my favourite paintings btw ;-P) Still, I trust Leigh and I know she\u2019ll write a phenomenal sequel. She did with \u201cCrooked Kingdom\u201d and I have no doubt that she\u2019ll do it with \u201cRule of Wolves\u201d as well. This said, the pacing of this book was kind of surprising. I mean I certainly didn\u2019t expect it to be so slow at the beginning. There was a lot of information we needed to get in order to understand the current situation of Ravka and to say it\u2019s precarious wouldn\u2019t even get close to the truth. I guess if you\u2019d just say that they are screwed you\u2019d strike home. *lol*So yes, there\u2019s a lot of build-up and all the new players are introduced and evenly spread on the chessboard. I think in a lot of ways this was a very serious book and even though Zoya\u2019s and Nikolai\u2019s banter was one of the highlights in \u201cKing of Scars\u201d there were a lot of severe moments that ultimately forced our beloved characters to grow. Which is always a good thing in my book! You know I\u2019m a sucker for character arcs and to see Nina, Zoya and Nikolai work things out was more than just amazing. Before I spoil anything I better just head over to my character section and write it all off my chest! ;-)The characters:\nWelcome to Ravka where bad news are the standard and scary winged creatures turn into kings during the day! *lol* The good news is: There\u2019s a lot to talk about! The bad news is that you\u2019ll be spoiled like crazy if you continue to read. So whatever you do, keep in mind that it was your own choice! ;-)\nNikolai:\u201dI\u2019ll find a way. All his life, Nikolai had believed that. His will had been enough to shape not only his fate but his own identity. He had chosen what he wanted people to see \u2013 the obedient son, the feckless rogue, the able soldier, the confident politician. The monster threatened all of that.\u201dI know a lot of people said that Nikolai isn\u2019t the charming Nikolai from the Grisha trilogy anymore and that they didn\u2019t like this. In my opinion this was only realistic though. I mean how is he supposed to be his charming and carefree self if there is a monster living inside of him? He\u2019s trying to save Ravka from hostile countries, he\u2019s dealing with a lot of problems in his own country and he\u2019s working really hard on uniting his people. And all this even though he turns into a monster at night. I can\u2019t even imagine how exhausted he truly is. Yet he still keeps up appearances and gives Ravka his all. I love that about Nikolai. He\u2019s a man of his people, his country always comes first and he\u2019d do everything to protect his land and the people within it. So yes, Nikolai might not be as easy-going as he used to be but he has thousands of reasons to be the way he is. My poor boy deserves a break and whenever I read about how much he loves Ravka and how tired he is my heart broke for him. T_T Can we get a happy Nikolai in the next book, please?! <333\u201dNikolai looked again at the old map of Ravka \u2013 violent, hopeless, unappeasable in its constant need. Ravka was his first love, an infatuation that had begun in his lonely boyhood and that had only deepened with age. Whatever it demanded, he knew he would give. He\u2019d been reckless with this country he claimed to love, and he could no longer let his fear dictate Ravka\u2019s future.\u201d \u201dI think I can fix it,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019ve always known Ravka is broken, and I\u2019ve seen the way it breaks people in return. The wars never cease. The trouble never stops. But I can\u2019t help believing that somehow, I\u2019ll find a way to outsmart all of the kings who came before and set this country right.\u201d He shook his head and laughed. \u201cIt is the height of arrogance.\u201d \u201dNikolai had always understood that he and Ravka were the same. He just hadn\u2019t understood how: He was not the crying child or even the drowning man. He was the forever soldier, eternally at war, unable to ever lay down his arms and heal.Zoya:\u201dShe intended to find a way to protect Grisha throughout the world so no one would ever have to live in fear or hide their gifts again \u2013 a governing body with representatives from every nation to hold their countries accountable, a guarantee of rights and of punishment for anyone who tried to imprison or harm her kind. I already said it in one of my updates and I\u2019ll say it again: Zoya is like a good wine that gets better with time. She\u2019s an acquired taste and I love her for it! *lol* I kinda lived and breathed for the little snippets we got about her life and her background story was truly heart-breaking. Liliyana sounded like such a great person and it\u2019s so sad that she died when the Darkling expanded the Fold. Also I can\u2019t believe her parents wanted to marry off Zoya at the tender age of 9!!! Like WTH is wrong with you people?! *GRRR* I\u2019m really glad she managed to escape that marriage and became a Grisha instead. I never thought I\u2019d grow so fond of her insulting tongue but haha she really grew on me in this one. Also OMG! Now that she has Juris\u2019s power will she be able to turn into a dragon too?! Because damn it, I\u2019d be so down for a Zoya dragon in the next book! XD That way she couldn\u2019t just spit fire with her sharp tongue but actually well, you know, SPIT FIRE!!! *lol* I\u2019m ready for it Leigh! Just bring it on! ;-)\u201dWhat will I do with this? Look at my old face?\u201d said Liliyana. \u201cSend it to your mother as a peace offering.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift for you,\u201d Zoya replied. \u201cSo you can look into it each morning and see the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\u201dBut the Darkling saw me clearly even then. \u2018Is that really what you wish to say?\u201d he asked.\u201dZoya pushed a dark strand of her hair behind her ear. \u201cSo I told him the truth. I put my chin up and said, \u2018They can all hang. It was my blood in the snow.\u201d Nina:\u201dSaints, she missed him. The ache of his absence felt like a hook lodged inside her heart. The hurt was always there, but in moments like these, it was as if someone had seized hold of the line and pulled.\u201d Ahhhhh!!! Nina was so savage in this! And I kinda liked it? XD What\u2019s wrong with me? *lol* On the one hand Nina\u2019s POV repeatedly ripped out my heart because the way her thoughts revolved around Matthias was just painful but on the other hand to see how strong she became also made me kind of proud? I mean Nina was always a very strong-willed character and did things her own way, but the Nina of \u201cKing of Scars\u201d was on an entirely new level! I mean WOAH! The way she dealt with the Wellmother and basically everyone else who got in her way. Boy, that girl means business! Yet she\u2019s still compassionate, gentle and kind. I think her experiences just made her a little more... I dunno ruthless? She knows none of the Fjerdans would show her mercy so she pays them back in kind. I\u2019m very curious how she\u2019ll develop and which kind of person she\u2019ll be at the end of this duology. No matter what happens I\u2019ll always love my Waffle Queen and that will never change! <3 (Also to everyone who watched \u201cShadow and Bone\u201d: I loved Nina in there! I\u2019m totally besotted with Netflix Nina. *lol*) \u201dNina tucked two tiny quail eggs into her skirts in case Trassel had a taste for the finer things, and found herself wondering if they might finish with sugared almond cookies. One could plot violent espionage and still hope for dessert.\u201d\u201dI told you I would pray for you,\u201d said Nina as she closed the door and issued her final command to her soldiers: Give her the mercy she deserves. Nina turned her back on the Wellmother\u2019s screams.\u201dThe Saints, Yuri and The Darkling:\u201dMost of us can hide our greatest hurts and longings. It\u2019s how we survive each day. We pretend the pain isn\u2019t there, that we are mad of scars instead of wounds. The hive does not grant me the luxury of that lie. I cannot go on this way. None of us can.\u201d Okay, I admit it: I never saw that plot line coming! Not even in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that Leigh would introduce us to living saints and that we\u2019d actually get to know some of them more closely. So that caught me totally off guard. I didn\u2019t like Yuri right from the beginning because he was your typical religious fanatic and well as it turned out to have him around was a big mistake. I knew something was up with Elizaveta but I would have never expected her to go that far! Like OMG! Why??!! Juris\u2019s and Zoya\u2019s friendship was great and Grigori kind of grew on me too. It\u2019s a shame both of them had to die because Elizaveta wanted to resurrect the Darkling and I can\u2019t believe... I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE she actually succeeded! I swear: The Darkling in Yuri\u2019s body at the ending was... THE. DEATH. OF. ME!!! I can\u2019t even!!! No, no I can\u2019t! I mean I love the Darkling but OH GOSH!!! I think I might need a little time to digest this. *lol*\u201dStop punishing yourself for being someone with a heart. You cannot protect yourself from suffering. To live is to grieve.\u201dThe relationships & ships:Zoya & Nikolai:Zoya batted Nikolai\u2019s quaking hands away from his buttons and took up the work herself. Through the thin cotton, she could feel the chill the night had left on his skin.\u201cWhat an excellent valet you make,\u201d he murmured. But she knew he hated submitting to these small attentions, hated that he was weak enough to require them.I SHIP IT! Badly! I never thought I\u2019d say this but Zoya and Nikolai are made for each other. They both know how to deal with court problems, they are strong and independent and they obviously have a soft spot for each other! <3 I loved the level of trust that is between them and they had so many little moments together. Their love is something that grows slowly like a delicate flower and I can\u2019t wait for them to realize how much they mean to each other. Nikolai comparing her to a strong drink was everything! *lol* We all know Nikolai could handle her and I want them to kiss and confess their love for each other! Also their banter!!! It\u2019s superior! I think Zoya might be exactly what Ravka needs and who knows, now that she\u2019ll be some sort of saint people will probably accept her at his side? I really hope those two will have a HEA because they both deserve it! Nikolai needs a woman like Zoya and I\u2019m convinced Zoya needs a man like Nikolai. So can they already kiss, please?! *lol*\u201dZoya, say something spiteful.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked faintly.\u201cBecause I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019m hallucinating, and in my dreams you\u2019re much nicer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Nikolai.\u201d\u201cNot your best work.\u201d\u201dIn that moment, he wished things might have been different. That he might not die tomorrow. That he could be led by his heart instead of duty.Because Zoya was not kind and she was not easy.But she was already a queen.\u201d\u201dOf course I\u2019ll come back,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone else to deliver my eulogy.\u201dA smile curled her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve written it already?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very good. You\u2019d be surprised how many synonyms there are for handsome.\u201dZoya closed her eyes. She turned her face, letting her cheek rest against this palm. \u201cNikolai \u2013\u201cNina & Hanne:\u201dNina studied her. There was something relentless in her features \u2013 the cheekbones sharp, the nose rigorously straight. Only the full thrust of her lips gave any hint of softness. It was a challenging face, stubborn in its lines. Beautiful.\u201dMhmm... To be frank I don\u2019t know how I feel about this new ship. I mean we all know I love a good f/f rep in my books and Nina deserves someone who will lover her the way she is. I\u2019m just not sure that person is Hanne. I wasn\u2019t convinced by their chemistry and it came out of nowhere. Like suddenly there is Hanne and Nina thinks she\u2019s beautiful but she\u2019s still grieving for Matthias so idk. *shrugs* And then she\u2019s Jarl Brum\u2019s child?! I mean I\u2019m currently very fond of K-Dramas but Nina having a relationship with Brum\u2019s child? I\u2019ve a tough time imagining it. Guess only time will tell if I\u2019ll be persuaded by this ship or not. \u201dIf I had just been a boy. If I had been the son my father wanted ...\u201dNina gripped Hanne\u2019s shouders. \u201cYou are perfect, Hanne. That your father can\u2019t value your strength speaks only to his weakness.\u201dEhri & Isaak:\u201dA reasonable gambit, but not one I was prepared to make.\u201dHe studied her. \u201cNot when you could simply wait for a pensive king to amble by and find you looking like a painting in green silk with flower in your hair?\u201d Her golden eyes shifted away guiltily. \u201cHow long were you waiting, hoping I might stroll by?\u201dShe bit her lip. \u201cTwo hours and twelve minutes. Give or take.\u201dThis was straight out of a Greek tragedy and I was really shook by this turn of events! Isaak grew on me and I really liked that boy and then BAM! Leigh killed him through Princess Ehri who wasn\u2019t even Princess Ehri to begin with. They were both posing as someone they were not and actually fell in love. This love story was nothing but tragic and I\u2019m still sad about it. They both deserved better and at another place and at another time they might have even been able to become lovers. T_T It\u2019s so heart-breaking. It\u2019s on the same level as Romeo and Juliet and ahhh my heart is still bleeding for those two. RIP Isaak! You did well, you were a great king and you could have been so much more! <333She pressed a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cMy only comfort is that you never could have been mine. But know that I would have gladly been yours.\u201d\u201cEhri,\u201d he moaned as the world began to go dark.\u201cNot Ehri.\u201d Conclusion:\u201cKing of Scars\u201d started out way more slowly than I thought it would, but the last couple of chapters totally made up for the slow beginning! My mind is still reeling from all those revelations and it might take a couple of days until I digested this ending. All told, I enjoyed this immensely and I can\u2019t wait to dive into the next book. Now that the stage is set I expect an epic finale in \u201cRule of Wolves\u201d and tell you what?

I really didn't love Shadow and Bone - actually, I kind of hated it - and subsequent books only disappointed me more. It was only my love for Six of Crows that kept me a fan of this world. But guys, this is a leaps-and-bounds improvement on the Grisha in terms of everything: the sheer writing quality, the thought put into the plot, the character development. All in all, while this wasn't perfect, it was a worthy and entertaining entry into this world.\n\n\u201cAll fuels burn differently. Some faster, some hotter. Hate is one kind of fuel. But hate that began as devotion? That makes for another kind of flame.\u201d\n\nI have always been a total sucker for post-war storylines - the post-chaos world of Six of Crows was always incredibly compelling to me, and this was possibly even better. Nikolai and Zoya are attempting to pick the pieces of their country up, hanging on by a delicate thread, as meanwhile, Nina attempts to save as many Grisha as possible. It's a situation in which there is no grand rebellion to have, no grand war - only a slow attempt at progress towards a better future. And it is fascinatingAnd I absolutely loved how this book handled generational trauma. The people of Ravka have only ever had kings and dictators and each leader has been worse than the last. And it is the Grisha who have suffered most, in the second army, under the Darkling, in each moment. It is utterly horrifying to realize the truth of how much this has affected every one of these people. I think King of Scars does an excellent job discussing agency, and the way everyone is victimized when war and oppression ravage a country. It's interesting - though the second half of this book is undoubtedly the faster one, I enjoyed my journey through the first half far more. The second half let me down, as we'll address later, but guys, the character development here is just so amazing. Notably, Leigh Bardugo has clearly hit her stride in third person pov - her ability to quickly craft interesting, developed, compelling leads cannot be overemphasized. King of Scars was, admittedly, pretty slow, but I had absolutely no trouble getting engaged, and it is all because of her character work. Here, we're following four leads:\u2192\nZoya,\n a Grisha general close to the king and attempting to work through her trauma. \u2192\nNikolai,\n the struggling but charismatic king of Ravka, who happens to be hiding a demon inside him. \u2192\nNina,\n a Grisha spy going home to bury her love in Fjerda, and maybe get in deeper along the way. \u2192\nIsaak,\n the only \"new\" character, a soldier plucked from obscurity to impersonate the king.(I also appreciated cameos by characters like Genya, David, Tamar, and Tolya; these four were some of my favorite characters in the original Grisha series, and I loved seeing them get involved.)\n\nYou cannot protect yourself from suffering. To live is to grieve. You are not protecting yourself by shutting yourself off from the world. You are limiting yourself.\n\nThree of these four lead characters are written exceptionally well, but Zoya's character arc is just incredible. Zoya started off as a bit of a mean girl character in the Grisha trilogy - a bit part, albeit an interesting one. Yet here, she shows her badass side and her more vulnerable one.\n\nHe thought he had grown used to his scars, but he had never grasped how much of his will it would take to hide them.\n\nNikolai's fate in the Grisha is definitely left a bit open for more development, and trust me, despite not being the star, he gets some great progression. In the Grisha, Nikolai is left as a part-monster, something he and Zoya desperately wish to solve. And in many ways, he is an actual King of Scars: his emotional scars, and his physical ones. Seeing him work through these was one the best parts of the book. There's a detail involving a childhood friend of his that I thought was just so sad, and beautifully written, that I cried. \n\n\u201cCall me Grisha. Call me zowa. Call me death, if you like.'\u201d\n\nNina in this book does not have a huge arc - actually, I felt her plot was more of a setup for her role in book two. But I still really loved my time reading her chapters. Her arc surrounding mourning, and surrounding revenge, is exceptionally well-written, and her plotline is tense, with high stakes and several new side characters. I was not expecting to be obsessed with the fate of Fjerda in a post-parem world, but I really liked what was done here: the idea of Nina staying a soldier, a girl who has changed the fate of history remaining unknown, is so interesting. There\u2019s a bit where Nina encounters a girl addicted to parem, and the raw echoing of her soul at that moment is just\u2026 so difficult and so well written. And I loved her two side characters, including Adric and Leoni (who was? saved? by Jesper\u2019s mom?) There's also a line where she fondly talks of \u201cthat little bastard Kaz\u201d and I laughed so hard I cried.Isaak is the only character here who's new to the book, and I felt that though his storyline was incredibly interesting, Bardugo didn't do as great a job with giving us a reason to care about him. In sharp contrast with the other three, I felt more invested in his plot than in his character development. I also, in a move surprising to both me and everyone else, really liked the romance. Nikolai and Zoya were an unexpected pairing, and yet... I love them? Their dynamic is so funny, most of the time, and then there are these little tender moments between the two that I absolutely love. Zoya is a character who does not trust in love, and seeing her consider letting someone back in was heartwrenching. (view spoiler)[The moment where Nikolai turns into a monster instinctually to save Zoya was just... incredible. One of the best scenes of the book. (hide spoiler)] And I'm also shocked and disappointed to not have heard more about Nina and her very-slow-burning enemies-to-lovers dynamic with Hanne, a Fjerdan Grisha girl. Hanne is a super well-written character and I really liked getting to know her; I think this couple will get more development in book two, but even what they have here is amazing. \n\n\u201cWe are all connected, King Nikolai. The Grisha, the Fold, the power inside you. The Fold is a wound that may never heal. But perhaps it was not meant to.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, I found the second half of this book... disappointing. From around 60% on, I struggled to suspend my disbelief on Zoya and Nikolai's plotline; it felt like a very odd, reaching extension of the general Grisha magic system. Bardugo also utilizes in a couple of plot reveals about two hours before the end, involving characters Secretly Being Shady, that I thought were so incredibly obvious they were barely plot twists. (view spoiler)[The saint? Yuri? The princess? The fact that I wasn't surprised by a single one of the three says something. (hide spoiler)] Nina's plotline, thankfully, was the best of the back half of the book. In contrast to my earlier comments, the plot reveals here were excellent, with well-done slow buildup; there are two specifically, one at the very end of the book, that I absolutely adored. I think Nina is going down a really dark path and I'm excited to see what happens next.There is one ending reveal here that I think people are going to be very torn on, as it removes a very large repercussion of the Grisha trilogy. (view spoiler)[I have never been a fan of bringing back defeated villains. (hide spoiler)] I, personally, can't decide how I felt about it. Possibly, this is because I was spoiled about this particular reveal and was expecting it to go down very differently; thus, I was pleasantly surprised by the actual manner of this twist. (view spoiler)[There's an interesting setup here - the Darkling is here, but under control. It could be a trainwreck. Possibly. Or it could be FASCINATING. (hide spoiler)] I just hope Leigh Bardugo knows what she's doing.\n\n\u201cA handsome monster husband who put a crown on her head? It\u2019s a perfect fairy tale to sell to some starry-eyed girl. She can lock you in at night and kiss you sweetly in the morning, and Ravka will be secure.\u201d\n\nAnyway, I genuinely enjoyed this book. It was certainly slower, but there were some excellent elements here, especially in terms of character development. And though the ending was a little disappointing, I think it sets up an excellent sequel. I can't wait to see what happens next.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "num_likes": 352, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["sff-high-fantasy", "4-star", "x-series", "y-2019releases", "trauma-abuse-recovery", "author-love", "z-2019reads", "sapphic-books-shelf"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2377833582", "review_id": "2377833582", "date": "Apr 30, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Hamad", "user_url": "/user/show/54464244-hamad", "text": "By this point I am pretty sure Leigh is a Heartrender, because the pain I am feeling can not be caused by humans!********************************************************This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription \u201cThe monster is me and I am the monster.\u201d\ud83c\udf1f Oh boy, it has been 3 months since I finished this and then went into a hiatus and here I am trying to remember how people actually write reviews. This may contain spoilers for the other books but I kept it spoiler free for the book itself\ud83c\udf1f Leigh Bardugo is like a superstar in the writing world, she\u2019s an auto-buy author for me and no introductions are needed when we are talking about her.The writing was great as usual (Not as good as Six of Crows but I didn\u2019t expect it to be anyway). I think Bardugo knows how to hit the right balance when writing, her books have the right amount of comedy, fights, drama and seriousness!\ud83c\udf1f Let\u2019s jump to the characters as I consider this mostly a character driven book. We have our golden boy Nikolai aka King of Scars. He was one of my favorite characters in the original trilogy and he retained what makes him\u2026him! \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d said Zoya. \u201cI\u2019m the king,\u201d said Nikolai. \u201cThat means you\u2019re early.\u201d \ud83c\udf1f Then we have Zoya who I also like, she\u2019s the strong female protagonist that many people like in a story. She may actually be the main character in this story, I read this 3 months so my memory is a little bit rusty but I believe that she had more pages than the other character. I read a review mentioning her romance with Nikolai and I just was like: Really, was I supposed to ship them together? I felt that the chemistry between them is a little bit off.Zoya grows a lot on this book and although some people wanted more Nikolai and less Zoya, I wasn\u2019t bothered by this as I love both.\ud83c\udf1f There is also Nina\u2019s POV and depending on how long you have been following me you would know how much I love Nina. She\u2019s still the same sassy powerful grisha she was. I also did not like the romance she was getting into. I mean, after what happened in CK, I think she needs more time to move on.\ud83c\udf1f What about the plot?The first half was slow and kind of hard to get into which may not be for all readers. The second part Bardugo snapped and I was having like double the entertainment I had in part 1.Funny thing is that I expected the major twist (which I was not happy with) and did not expect a smaller twist that was good! After reading summaries of the original trilogy, I just knew where this was going.I mean the good part of the plot is how realistic the story is if the Grishaverse was true but the bad part was how it affects major parts of the original trilogy just to satisfy fans which is a major pet peeve for me. I can see people separated into pleased or angry groups!\ud83c\udf1fSummary and Prescription: I enjoyed KoS as it had great writing and characters. I was not happy with the romance and ending.

I'll be honest, the Grishaverse has been sort of mixed for me. I liked Shadow and Bone, hated Seige and Storm, and really enjoyed Ruin and Rising (though not how it ended if you know what I'm talking about). Then I read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom and I loved them. In my opinion, Leigh's Six of Crows series is the best one out of all of them.So, when she announced King of Scars, I was already sold on it. When Nikolai was introduced in Seige and Storm, I didn't really pay much attention to him but I remember liking him a lot in Ruin and Rising. When it was announced he was getting his own story, I wanted to read it so bad. Not to mention King of Scars would also have Zoya and Nina as main characters too. Everything leading up to the release sounded so good.Then... I read the book.Listen, I really, really, really, REALLY, wanted to enjoy it. I had high hopes for it only to be left disappointed. By the time I reached 100-pages, I knew I wouldn't enjoy it. But I kept telling myself that it may get better. That's how it is for most books; slow beginning but great middle and end. Except, I was still bored by the time I got to the middle and end.King of Scars, in my own opinion, is Leigh's weakest book so far. I know that's a bold opinion, but that's how I feel. Which is really disappointing considering how I was so looking forward to reading King of Scars.I also think that naming this the Nikolai duology is kind of misleading. As mentioned, this story does have the POV of Zoya and Nina so this isn't a Nikolai focused series. Which doesn't help because I was not a fan of Nikolai. More on that to come. Not everything was negative though. The only thing that prevented me from giving this story a 1-star rating is Zoya. Zoya saved this book from being terrible. She is the diamond in the rough among all the coal. She is a strong character both in the physically (or magically) and internally. Though this is Nikolai's book, I feel that this was also Zoya's book as well. We get to know more about her and why she's the way she is. Though some of her chapters did drag on, I still think she's the best character out of everyone else.Now, strap in folks, 'cause we're about to go into the negatives.The pacing of the story was unbearably slow. There's such a thing as slow pacing and unnecessarily slow pacing. Slow pacing, while it can be a bit boring, adds in some stuff about the world and the people. It's slow, yes, but it gives the reader all the information they needed. Then there's unnecessarily slow where the pacing is slow for no reason other than to add in some useless information and sentences. I kid you not when I say a good hundred pages could've been left out.And because of the slow pacing, it makes the political aspect of the story all the duller. Since Nikolai is the king of Ravka, he has a lot of things to do especially with two other countries who aren't friendly to Ravka. I do like when politics are in books so long as it's engaging and helps move the plot forward. But it wasn't the same in King of Scars. The characters, other than Zoya, were watered down characters of what they were in the previous books. Specifically, Nikolai and Nina. They were lifeless and devoid of any warmth or development throughout the book. Nikolai was not the same Nikolai he was in the Shadow and Bone trilogy. I thought I was reading a completely different character at times. He did not feel like Nikolai. Everything about him from the previous books was nowhere to be found and he was just dull and lacked the personality that made him who he is.Then there's Nina. I'm just gonna say it since I'm being brutally honest with my review: Nina and her chapters were completely redundant. Again, another bold opinion. But I'm not holding back. Her character and chapters were nothing but disappointments. I get why she's in the story, especially after reading the Six of Crows series, but I was bored of not only her but her story as well. She wasn't the same Nina as she was before. I do understand why she's here, but I just didn't care for her. And her chapters were unnecessarily long.Speaking of unnecessary and redundant, there's a character introduced in the second half of the story, Isaak and... who are you and why should I care about you? The second I saw the chapter with his name on it, I was kind of irritated. I had to go through over two hundred pages of slow pacing along with Nina's long chapters, and now we are introduced to another character. I did not care for Isaak. I skimmed most of his chapters because they were boring.My final issue would be the transitions between different plotlines. There are three in total. Nikolai and Zoya dealing with strange things happening in Ravka. Nina doing undercover work in Fjerda. And Isaak doing something I can't explain without spoiling it. And they did not transition well with each other. Nina's could qualify as its own book/novella. I just didn't see the point in adding Nina's story along with Isaak. Yes, their placement in the story made sense. But the transitions weren't done right. Instead, we got a mishmash of plotlines.\nVerdict\nI really am disappointed to give this a 2-star rating. There was so much to like about this book. But all I got were watered down characters, very slow pacing, bad transitions between stories, and some redundancy.Will I read the sequel? Yes, but my expectations are going to be VERY low. I've learned my lesson. The Grishaverse is an interesting universe. Is it perfect? No, but it does have its shining moments, especially in the Six of Crows series. It's just a shame King of Scars didn't live up to the hype.Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar", "num_likes": 282, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2463847415", "review_id": "2463847415", "date": "Jan 29, 2019", "rating": "", "user_name": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "user_url": "/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "text": "This just came out today!!I can't wait to find out what happens to my favorite character... but apparently I have to be a reasonable adult and finish Crooked Kingdom first :/", "num_likes": 250, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2657215331", "review_id": "2657215331", "date": "Jan 31, 2019", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Charlotte May", "user_url": "/user/show/14002983-charlotte-may", "text": " \"I always figured I'd die young...why not do it shoving my foot up that murderer's ass.\" That ending?!???!!! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31Actual rating 3.75 starsI, as so many other goodreaders, was BEYOND excited when I heard this book was coming out, I ordered it from the library as soon as I could, and my hopes were sky high.There are 4 POVs, so I'll review based on each character.Isaak: I can't reveal too much of Isaak's POV because spoilers. But he is a guard in Nikolai's palace, and when his chance comes to serve Ravka, and to serve his King, he doesn't hesitate.Nina: This was the POV I was most excited for. I ADORED Nina in SOC and CK. But for some reason, I found it really hard to connect to her in King of Scars. She is on a mission, with Leoni and Adrik in Fjerda to help Grisha prisoners and provide more soldiers to Ravka's cause. I guess it felt like her chapters were like a side adventure to the main plot going on, and I wasn't a fan of (view spoiler)[ the romance between her and Hanne.  (hide spoiler)] For me it felt waaaaay too soon, and it just felt like it was thrown in for the sake of it, not necessary at all to her story.Zoya: Now I'll admit, I really didn't like Zoya in The Grisha Trilogy. She was mean, unnecessarily so imo, and therefore really hard to warm up to. But giving her a POV in this book really changed my view! We get to learn about her childhood and background, and also the way The Darkling completely screwed her over. So I ended up thinking that the front she puts on actually makes a lot of sense, and she became so much more understandable and relatable. Also at times just plain hilarious!Nikolai: Last but ABSOLUTELY not least. I loved Nikolai's character in the Grisha Trilogy, maybe not as much as some of the superfans, but definitely a decent amount. The plot surrounding him was very interesting (view spoiler)[ he has a dark monster inside him, left behind from when he was attacked by The Darkling. When they visit the fold to see if anything can be done to remove it they are kidnapped by the \"saints\" who say that if they complete this ritual he can be rid of the darkness and they can be freed from the eternity they are currently stuck in within the fold.  (hide spoiler)]I didn't love the ending. I will admit I was shocked by it, so that is something. But I guess I can admit I didn't entirely understand how it all worked. (view spoiler)[ Nikolai is tricked by Saint Elizabeta, who was actually trying to resurrect The Darkling and rule with him. But as the darkness starts to leave Nikolai she funnels it into The Darkling's body (which she conveniently tells us that she stole before the others burned it in Ruin and Rising.) But Zoya stops her (with Saint Juris as an amplifier) so Nikolai doesn't die, but the Darkling's power flees its body as it is destroyed and runs to the nearest vessel (the body of Yuri the Darkling obssessed monk.)  (hide spoiler)]The whole ending just came out of nowhere and bashed me in the face, I was a bit like, wait...what?Overall entertaining and I loved being reunited with some of the characters, just a few minor gripes. **************************************\u201cYour library copy is ready for pick up\"Me - *runs to the library as fast as my little legs will carry me*", "num_likes": 242, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["500-page-plus", "epic-fantasy", "tear-jerker", "ya", "romance"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3919373420", "review_id": "3919373420", "date": "May 27, 2021", "rating": 4, "user_name": "ale \u2661", "user_url": "/user/show/101179363-ale", "text": "\n\u201cMost women suffer thorns for the sake of the flowers, but we who wield power adorn ourselves with flowers to hide the sting of our thorns\u201d\nMy review might has some spoilers, watch out!Read my long review \nhere\nThis will be a review of me drooling over Nikolai fucking Lantsov and Zoya my queen Nazyalensky.First of all, say that this book took me a while isn't enough. I first started King of Scars on March 31st, 2021. A whole fucking year. I put it on hold because I just couldn't move on from page 212. I was stucked there.I love Nina, I swear I do. She's one of my favorite characters, but... What the fuck was this? Don't get me wrong, I was excited to see her grief process and everything and I cried so so so fucking much when she let go Matthias (my second fave boy ever after Nikolai) because it hurt me so bad in Crooked Kingdom. Leigh, I will never forgive you for this. But the moment Hanne stepped in, everything went to trash. I like Hanne, but since the first moment I knew who she was and who're gonna be endgame.It pissed me off because I felt that Nina's grief was gone in 0.1 seconds. Idk if she stills thinking and grieving Matthias, I skipped her chapters and I'm not ashamed of it. If it hadn't been for that, I would have put this book again in my \"on hold\" shelf or dnf'd.Once again, I love Nina, but her chapters were unbearable to me. :(Zoya's development was great. She's been my favorite character for a while and knowing her background and story in a new level of depth was everything to me. Her friendship with Juris was really nice (tho a little bit short and rushed) and how they bonded. Zoya is a fucking badass, and, as Nikolai said, a queen.Nikolai is the king of my heart (iykyk) and my everything. He's the main reason why I stopped liking the same dark haired and badboy dudes. I mean, they're okay, but a blond king, a charming and funny boy who's arrogant but sweet and romantic and a fucking gentleman who fight with his own demons? That's hot af and what drew me to him.I was really really really in love with the Darkling when I first read Shadow and Bone (and Ben Barnes feeded my obsession, lol) and then I ended up ditching him when I met the handsome Nikolai Lantsov. Holy fuck, I fell for Nikolai really hard and at this day, my standards are really high just because of him.Anyways, I'm rating this book 4 stars for the end of the book.Overall, I feel like this book was like a big \"what the fuck?\" for me. What was that thing of bring back the Saints, Leigh? Juris and Grigori were okay, but Elizaveta? I should have known that the Darkling is still popular even after his death... My bad.The fact that I didn't care much for the other characters says a lot of me. I love Genya, David, Tolya and Tamar, but they were just... there. I hope I'll get to see them more in RoW.Unfortunately, I won't pick up Rule of Wolves anytime soon because I have tons of books that I'm currently reading haha, but I definitely will in a future.\nprevious review:\nokay, i'm rating it 4 stars because of that ending.holy fuck, i remember that i was really in love with that bastard, but nikolai is better anyways.RTC", "num_likes": 239, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["action", "badass-female-mc", "fiction", "lgbt", "badass-male-mc", "fantasy", "high-fantasy", "magic", "dragons", "duology"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2620106982", "review_id": "2620106982", "date": "Feb 05, 2019", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Samantha", "user_url": "/user/show/10067920-samantha", "text": "Oh.

And during the first half, that's what I got. Plain and simple. Reading about the characters dear to my heart live their lives. Note that I'm not complaining : I know many readers grumbled about pacing issues and I definitely see where they're coming from. In the end however, I genuinely do not care if a fantasy novel isn't fast paced as long as I'm not bored, and I was too invested in Leigh Bardugo's gift at storytelling (and ZOYA) to be.Some books are only the sum of their twists, and I think it's a gage of its quality that King of Scars is not. Even though I've known the ending since its release, it had no impact on my enjoyment.Indeed my attention was captured almost instantly, even though I'll admit that the first half contains more planning than action. Yet there's something to be said about quiet fantasy novels that manage to worm their way into our heart by making us care deeply about their characters, and it was my experience with King of Scars : I loved getting glimpses of Zoya's childhood especially, and her friendship with Nikolai gave me life. So many scenes affected me, too : from Nina's grief to her fight for giving a voice to silenced women ; from Nikolai's easy banter to his inner doubts ; every one of these characters struggle with guilt, whether they have a reason to or not.Above all, they evolve throughout the story, and I'm grateful for it because it would have been so easy for Leigh Bardugo to rest on her laurels. In my opinion she doesn't. She takes the risk to surprise - and annoy - her readers at times, and I respect that. The distance between adding layers to characters and making them act out of character is thin sometimes, but I believe that she navigated those dangerous waters with skill. It certainly drove home the message that war and loss change us in ways that we don't expect, and as I don't care for pro-war rhetoric, I was very on-board with that.The second half proved excellent, and the way the threads were developed and weaved together made for a compelling - and so emotional at times - tale. I really don't care for\u00a0that\u00a0ending, but I knew it was coming, so. *shrugs* I've made peace with it.I have a question, though : are the Darkling fanatics a metaphor for readers who can't accept that it's okay to stan a villain (I certainly did) without him being a love interest (ew, seriously, ew)? Probably not, but it amused me to believe that they were. That scene when Zoya remembers everything he did and is like, the fuck you stan him? was *chef's kiss*. I've seen reviews complaining that it was too much and disrespectful (????) to Darkling fans and honestly, it just makes me laugh. I've never hidden that he was my favorite character from the first trilogy, but what I'm not about to do is romanticize his behavior when he's been written as a villain so clearly from the very beginning. I understand feeling let down by Ruin & Rising ending - I certainly was, but I'm eager to reread it now that my feminism evolved and that I realized that it's fucked-up to resent women's choices, even if it doesn't align with what we perceive as powerful - but that doesn't excuse some of the appalling behavior I've seen all over goodreads and twitter. I mean, you do you. Just don't expect people to endorse you. Bottom Line : Nina, Zoya and Nikolai's endings made me excited about reading Rule of Wolves, and I'm definitely going to do just that sometime in the next weeks.

The spoiler section of this book is at the bottom of my revieuw and marked as spoilers   King of Scars  is the first book in the King of scars duology by Leigh Bardugo. This duology is a spinoff series from both the grisha triology and the six of a crows duology. It follows some of the side charracters that appeared in the shadow and bone triology with Nikolai aka my precious sarcastic bby who also has a broken side too his sunshine personality because of his inner demon and Zoya who we know as the mean girl with some growth in the grisha triology that we get too know much better in this book. as main charracters with their own povs. And it also follows one of the main charracters from six of a crows ; Waffle queen Nina Zenik. The events that play itself in this book are all happening  AFTER  both of these other series so its a must that before you read this one you readed the shadow and bone triology and the six of a crows duology. Otherwise you are just lost , you just have too. It takes place right after both the other books. Nina is in Fjerda with Matthias body too put his body too rest and yes this made me freaking sad. She is with Aldrik and Leonie also two grisha , aldrik who we already know ofcourse. They are on a mission too collect Grishas in fjerda for the second army on behave of our Nikolai. Once there things happen tho and they discover some serious secrets regarding the grisha in the country. Meanwhile Nikolai is batteling the demon that is still inside hi, , a piece of the darkling his power while he tries too restore Ravka as king allong side with Zoya who is now his general. But magical events appear troughout Ravka that are very weird and they go look what they are allong with Yuri who believs the darkling is a saint , yep a saint you heard that correctly ehmmm who they can or cant trust.Overall i loved this book somuch. It has the great grisha worldbuilding that i have always loved in leigh her other books in this universe while it also explores new elements in the world regarding the powers that you just have too see for yourself which i personally loved. It has 3 amazing main charracters who are all true warriors but not perfect , all 3 of them struggle with their current inner demons and their struggles in life while trying too save Ravka and Grisha , it has a hint at romance which is very slowburn which i freaking loved and its full of great banter between all the charracters we follow. The plot is quite fast and intresting and a great ballance between politics and fantasy and charracter driven parts. I did was a little bored with one of the three povs sometimes thats why this isnt a 5 star. [ which was Nina her pov , still love this waflle queen to death tho dont worry ] Overall it was just great ! i really reccomend it if you want more nikolai , its also definitly way more mature then the grisha triology. more like six of a crows level. The plot , the World  The book is divided intoo two parts. Part one is definitly more a set up for part two and very politic focused and i loved it , their was lots of banter which made you continue and continue too read just look at all this banter i live for this ;  '' I like too keep you on your toes Nazyalensky. Constant anxiety does wonders for the complexion. '' i will send you a thank-you card '' make sure of it. You are positively glowing.  I also love that we get too know the charracters much better while it also stays plot focused , a great ballance. The second part is where thing go down very down like wtf. it has somany twistst that i loveeeed. It also has another layer too the grisha world and the magic which i have seen mixed opinion on but i personally loved it. More about that in detail in my spoiler section for those of you who are intrested in more thoughts on that from me. Zoya and Nikolai their povs where antertaining the whole book. We also follow Nina and i love this girl and i did like the plot but it did feel like a total different book sometimes which made the switch a little meh sometimes and then her plot felt a bit boring compared too the other plot but it wasnt terrible at all ! just a little more boring. Charracters   Nikolai  - i love this guy somuch. Favorite male charracter of all time forever. We know him as the sarcastic sunshine charracter but in this book Leigh really shows us another part of him and shows us that being charming can sometimes be a bit of a mask too hide the inner demon and your mental struggles as it also does with Nikolai after all he has been trough in the war. But the way this guy stays positive no matter what and keeps fighting for himself , his country and his friends is just amazing. I have somuch respect for him and i love him too death.  Thankyou somuch Leigh for adding this depht too his charracter and showing the struggle behind the charm < 3 that is so important.   Zoya  Zoya is a charracter that i hated in the first two books of the grisha triology because the girl on girl hate she did and i have not forgiven her , in the third book she changes and we see in this book why she did. We get too know her a lot more in this book and a lot more about the past. She is like Nikolai a charracter that doesnt seem affraid and is quite mean and can be a bitch but inside she is afraid and afraid of caring because of her past. this isnt an excuse for behaviour but it does explain it and makes her morally grey. She is a warrior and i came too like her a lot in this book and respect her ,  so thanks Leigh for writing this backstory and again showing people arent what they seem too be and what they show other people too be.  Nina Zenik  My waffle queen. She is so fucking strong. i loved her somuch in six of crows and still love her. In this book she deals with grieve because of Matthias his death. This hurt me somuch my bbys. and its so important that her grieve wasnt just gone in one second , Leigh really made her grieve which is important , its life. I also love how fierce Nina is and how brave she is for the things she believes in. what . a . strong . female . we stan ! + she loves waffles. Nina is me. me = Nina. i relate too her.  '' It could become quite the rage. Toffee baths and waffle scrubs. ''  The side charracters where also all great. We have Genya who i love and David and the two of them together are so funny and cute. We have the twins ofcourse , Nadia and we have Aldrik. We also have a new side charracter Isaak which i wont tell more about as its spoilerish. who was nice. They all have a personality and arent flat or not worked out which i love. And we have Hanne a fjerdan girl that meets up with nina her pov who i liked ! what a feminist brave warrior soul.  Romance , dynamics  we have a dynamic going on between Zoya and Nikolai which i live for. They fit so well and the slow burn aaah. The banter ? sign me up. i need them too be together in rule of wolves. Nina also has a potentioal new love intrest maybe? and i feel okay with that. Leigh is just great at slowburn and banter between love intrestst.  Overall i love this book a lot and i am so freaking excited for rule of wolves plz illumicrate edition arrive soon !!  SPOILER SECTION !!!!!!!!  -  about the second part of the plot in spoilers  i actually love the saints storyline. I also noticed this ; the three saints all resemblance our main charracters. Juris showed Zoya who she could be if she accepts her past and herself with it , Elizaveta shows the upcoming betrayel of Yuri , the bear x human ; Grigori and his uncontroled form changing showed nikolai and the monster. i just loved this and the twistst where awesomeee. fucking darkling you bastard grrr. - Nikolai accepting his inner demon instead of it being just fixed is cheff kiss and so important. sometimes you cant go back too the person you where before traumatic events happen and nikolai realizes that and accepts that and accepts that he is different now and struggles.", "num_likes": 203, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorite-reads"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2667265503", "review_id": "2667265503", "date": "Apr 26, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lucy Tonks", "user_url": "/user/show/90494494-lucy-tonks", "text": "\n\u201cStop punishing yourself for being someone with a heart.

Now it did, oh my god, it actually did. Why do I love this book so much? Why? Why am I so attached to these \u200bcharacters? *screams*The King. The General. The Spy. Nikolai Lantsov has endure a lot - more than his people could know and he would like it for it to stay that way - so he could have peace in his country, but there's still a log road ahead for the peace that Ravka needs. Each day a dark magic grows more and more, threatening everything. Zoya Nazyalensky is now the general of the Grisha army. She does every in her power to rebuilt and help Nikolai secure his throne. Nina Zenik is dealing with her grief and her new power while on a mission in Fjerda. They will stop at nothing to help their broken country. \n\u201cYou are strong enough to survive the fall\u201d\nThe characters in this book are just everything. I love them with my whole heart and I will love them no matter what. Nikolai and Zoya have both been two of my favourite characters in the Shadow and Bone trilogy, but now having them as main charcters, my love for them has just amplified so much more. There's so much that we don't know about them in the original trilogy, because obviously we don't follow them as main characters, and I was just so intrigued now with seeing their stories from their POV, seeing everything Alina has missed or just didn't know about either of them, especially Zoya. There are just so many things we don't know about her and here we basically learn how she came to be the Zoya that we know. We see them dealing with everything they've witness during the war, three years later. The war has affected them both in such different ways and even those years weren't enough to dull the pain they've felt. Nina, on the other hand, is dealing with the grief after everything that has happened at the end of Crooked Kingdom and everyday she is learning how she can control or use her power more effectively. You can see through out the story how this grief has changed her. We know Nina because of her character in the Six of Crows duology, but here we see her very much changed. We see her dealing with everything while she is also trying to save Grishas and give them a chance at living. In this book we are also introduced to new character, Hanne which i absolutely loved. The interctions between her and Nina were everything and she has so much potential for the next book and the development she could have. I cannout wait too see wht Laigh has in store for her charcter. \n\"Hopeless. Hungry. Desperation makes people do ugly things, and it is always the girls who suffer first.\"\nThe first half of the book can be a bit slow and boring, but once I got to part two the action has started. I just couldn't really put the book down after that point, I just needed to know what will happen next (even on my re-read, there was so many things I just forgot and there were times when I was truly shocked about how the turn of events), I needed answers. I originally rated this book 4 stars because of that slow beginning, but I've realised now that I just loved this so much that I cannot rated it anything lower than five stars. It's truly one of my favourite Leigh Bardugo books, mostly because of the cast of characters. As much as I loved Six of Crows and that cast of characters, no character, no one, can take Nikolai's place as my favourite character. Not even Inej or Wylan, so you can bet your butt I love this book because of him. The writing style, as always, is magnificant. Leigh Bardugo has one of the best writing styles ever. There are few authors whose works I've read and that can actually compete with her. I don't even know what's so special about her writing, but something obviously is if I'm loving it so much. I will always pick one of her works just because of this, of her writing style and as there's no book by her where I didn't fell in love with the writing. This story will forever have a special place in my heart. I just love this charcters, their interations, the plot, everything! Leigh Bardugo has become a master at creating stories and charcters and I juat want to applaud her for that! It's just amazing how this woman can craft a story. \n\"There had been a time when words had been the only place he could find solace.

By that I mean I can and will read 20 books in this world following the same characters and obvious fan services, will never get bored, and will absolutely rave about them and make it my only personality trait. So naturally, I loved this book and I refuse to be critical of it despite the things that warrant critism. King of Scars is set post-Civil War Ravka where Nikolai is King, but struggling to keep his country together. Zoya is his general, and along with Genya, David, Tolya, and Tamar, they must help Nikolai with this, and additionally keeping the monster that lives within him a secret. Nina on the other hand is in Fjerda with Adrik and Leoni on a mission to rescue Grisha and help them get to Ravka. We get Nikolai, Zoya, and Nina's point of views, as well as Isaak, a character that has more significance in the second half of the book. Unlike with Six of Crows, in order to understand the events of this story you must read Shadow and Bone. *** spoilers will be hidden, and they will not only consist of spoilers for this book, but also S&B and SoC ***~ Nikolai ~\n\nThere had been a time when words had been the only place he could find solace.\n\nListen, I want to say that I am Nikolai's #1 fan, but I think they title belongs to everyone that has \"(nikolai's version)\" in their profile name. It's unhinged behavior and I love it. Nikolai is just as hilarious and lovable as in the original trilogy. Usually characters that shine as side characters don't do as well as main characters, but this was not a problem I saw in this book. I liked hearing his perspectives and inner thoughts. ~ Zoya ~\n\n\"All those lives lost, all we've worked for, and these fools are so ready to rewrite history.\"\n\nIt's not \"my ruthless Zoya\", it's OUR ruthless Zoya. There are few things I love more than the morally grey ruthless female character archetype in books. I wasn't the biggest fan of Zoya in S&B, but I absolutely adored her in this duology. Hearing her backstory and seeing all the layers to her has boosted her to my top 5 all time favorite Grishaverse characters along with Nikolai, Inej, Kaz, and Jesper. I honestly think I enjoyed her pov the most. ~ Nina ~\n\nShe wished she had Inej's gift for spywork or Kaz's gift for scheming, but she only seemed to have Jesper's gift for bad decisions.\n\nNina Zenik hate will not be tolerated by me. She's such a relatable and lovable character. She's confident, but also has struggles. (view spoiler)[Her mourning of Matthias' death is a big part of her chapters. (hide spoiler)] I really felt disconnected from her pov at first because I didn't understand its relevance, especially since I went into this book thinking this was Nikolai's book, but as the book went, it got much better. ~ Isaak ~\n\n\"Everyone mourns the first blossom. Who will grieve the rest that fall?\"\n\nI have no real opinions on him or his pov. He was a sweetheart, but also incredibly naive. I thought his plotline was interesting, but not interesting enough. Other opinions I have~\u2022 \"My ruthless Zoya, I'll load the gun myself\" and \"Yuri Vedenen, if you upset my wife again, I will kill you where you stand\" is peak romance. \u2022 (view spoiler)[Hate that the Darkling is back. He's such an attention whore. I can't believe this degenerate used the \"you and I are going to change the world\" not on one person, not on two, but on three people. And that's only in this duology. Who knows how many other times he has said it. He should have stayed dead. (hide spoiler)]\u2022 We got background information about why it's called the Grishaverse when Grisha translates to Greg. I'm not sure if Bardugo made that explanation after seeing the Gregverse jokes and critism, or it was purposeful and planned from the beginning. \u2022 Yuri is so annoying. When Zoya said, \"We should send him to Ketterdam to preach to Kaz Brekker and the rest of those reprobates\"...yeah. I want to see that. \u2022 I liked seeing characters like Genya, David, Tolya, and Tamar again. I love them all. \u2022 I'm really disappointed that there wasn't more Adrik and Leoni content. They are the grumpy x sunshine trope personified, and I just wanted more of them. I feel robbed. \u2022 I don't have much opinions on Hanne. I'm pretty indifferent, but I think the fact that they are (view spoiler)[the Grisha daughter of Jarl Brum is really interesting. (hide spoiler)]Overall, I had a good time revisiting Ravka.

Nikolai's and Nina's stories deserved closure. But not the fanfiction Bardugo turned this book into. I am shaken and I am disappointed. \u27bd 500+ pages were too much for this book. It was slow; nothing really was happening. Half the book was a clear recap of Grisha books and a desperate attempt to copy the style of Six of Crows, which didn't work here if you ask me. And honestly, the whole story felt like fanfiction, aimed to soothe the fans' anger at some stuff that happened in both Grisha and Six of Crows series. \u27bd I am once again facing the butchering of my native language. I accept no more excuses like: Bardugo simplified the language to adapt it for English speaking readers and so on. NO. It is simply a lazy job. Some things need only be googled. One minute and you get it right. I will only mention here: Korol Rezni from Russian means King of Massacre, not King of Scars. So Bardugo didn't even get the essential thing right. *RANT TIME! BEWARE THE SPOILERS!!*\u27bd Nina, who I loved so much in Six of Crows, got her POV here as well. At first, her heartfelt journey to acceptance and redemption made me love her more; the scene where she was burying Matthias was simply beautiful and so much-needed closure for all of us. But ten minutes later Bardugo introduces us to Nina's new love interest: Hanne! I am sorry Bardugo, but I haven't shed so many tears and suffered so much to see you pairing Nina with some girl I care nothing about. It didn't feel right to do that so soon after Matthias died. Just no! \u27bd Nikolai and Co. did feel like Kaz and Co. Do you remember funny Nikolai from Grisha? I don't. Because here he was overshadowed by the carboard version of Nikolai. Zoya, on the other hand, was fury and power, but I didn't really care about the 'girl saves the day' concept nor was I eager for the growing chemistry between Nikolai and Zoya. \u27bd Now, I don't know how to call the direction the plot took rather than delusional? Why on earth would Bardugo resurrect the Darkling?! Ah, of course, I've totally forgotten it's a fanfiction, and for the sake of fans, we get the Dark Prince rising *turns on the zombie music* No. I was a fan of the Darkling. I didn't like that Bardugo killed him off in Grisha. But I accepted it and went on with my life. But, no, it was not enough to burn him once, you had to do it twice and then he still came back in a body of a different character. Terminator has nothing on the Darkling-zombie. I am sorry but I can't and won't accept that twist. Overall, I guess my romance with Grishaverse ends here. I have no regrets nor do I have a desire to keep up the charade of pretending I am still interested in these books.

I guess we can say it was remarkable in that sense.\n\u201cLost faith is the roots of a forgotten wood, waiting to thrive once more.\u201d\nKing of Scars is a book with a lot of great ideas...gone awry. Don't get me wrong, I was impressed me with how it explores the different beliefs and the power of belief; be it in yourself, divinity, or your country. There was a lot of genius in there...but the inconsistency was like an avalanche of rotten dirt, and my realisation that I no longer trusted Leigh Bardugo to tell me a remarkable tale, the shout that would set the burying of my dreams in motion.Here's the thing: it's all about trust\u2014about whether you're sure you're in good hands. And you'd think Leigh Bardugo, one of my faves, would be one I'd trust so much I'd hand her a poisoned dagger and turn my back to drown in her world, mindlessly, knowing she can swim and will always have my back. *sighs* If only that were true...\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wolves who go unseen that eat the most sheep.\u201d\nI did trust her at first, and enjoyed the first half, unconcerned about anything, knowing I was in good hands; but when the veil was literally ripped away and I saw the book for what it was...I didn't find her worthy of my trust, and saw no reason to turn a bind eye to this:We have two characters and an author; let's name them N, Z, and L; author L is supposedly writing a book for N, but she's so in love with Z that she spends half of 500 pages obsessing over her\u2014to a point that she forgets the book's about N at all. And with that infatuation, not only does she fail in telling N's story, she also questions the meaning of a good leader by praising Z for being ruled by anger and arrogance. I love Z, but I don't wanna read a fangirl's biased writing\u2014not to mention being lied to, as it's my fault that I picked this up for N because that's what the title said.I feel deceived, disappointed, and angry with such problematic choices by an author I love. Not to forget the name-dropping of all these mind-blowing concepts and down-playing every. one. Bardugo shook the foundation of the Grishaverse...like a kid who has built this magnificent toy house but gets bored, picks it up, shakes it like a maniac, and leaves a ruin in shambles, scattered and senseless.Important for reading KoS: as a series in Grishaverse, you should read both of the other series in the world to get to this. You can find them at the end of review under \u2018related books\u2019.\nStoryline\n\n\u201cSomething is out there, riding the storm.\u201d\nNear 3 years after the events of Ruin and Rising, with more than 6 months since Crooked Kingdom, Nikolai Lantsov has to strengthen his weakened kingdom and prevent a war, all while being secretly haunted by the lasting consequences of what he endured during the civil war. He is drowning\u2014and a scholar monk and cult leader devoted to a dark Saint is the unexpected saviour he's needed to make sense of the clues and embark on a journey to save himself and his people. The truth he finds at the end of the road is astonishing in its impossibility. But then again, nothing is impossible; only improbable.Up in the north, Nina puts herself back together, now on a mission to save Fjerdan Grisha as an undercover agent of the Ravkan government. Her storyline starts slow as she finds herself and her purpose\u2014and a suspicious factory in a small town. There, she lies and deceives masterfully, making Kaz proud.And this is just the beginning; KoS only prepares the stage for a new age on the way\u2014an age of Saints, with players that could destroy everything in their way...\nMy thoughts:\n putting aside the fact that Nikolai's the story just made no sense in the second half with that twist that was just \u201cughh what??\u201d there were 2 plot points that ruined it;1) The Great Darkness: one might say Nikolai's grappling with a darkness within him is like Mare in \nGlass Sword\n\u2014(view spoiler)[both trying to beat their demons, the book ending with them not completely defeating it but starting to confront it for it to continue in the rest of the series (hide spoiler)]\u2014then why did I adore it in GS but find it a weak point in KoS? Two reasons:a) with Mare we saw her drown in hatred and isolation, Aveyard capturing that state of mind deftly; we saw her desire to kill and hurt, we shared her messed up mind...it was utterly magnificent! However, Nikolai's oh-so-terrifying oh-so-deadly demon is\u2014*audience leans in*\u2014self doubt\u2014*audience starts booing* I do understand how much harm self doubt can cause, specially in a king, but in trying to connect the gloriously terrifying villain who left that darkness and the things he was capable of, with this...small...demon, I come up empty; ridiculous.b) even if we say there was no risk bc of the Triumvirate, the problem is that, again, too much focus on Zoya's arc took a great toll on Nikolai's struggles, making his journey as lacking as an empty cask of water in a burning desert.2) The Chosen One: *in a museum tour-guide voice, pointing to my rotten bones* here we have the remnants of a once great woman, viciously murdered by a Chosen One trope gone so bad even cockroaches fled its overpowering smell *placard reads: blame it on Bardugo, King of Scars did this*I can only say, (view spoiler)[Juris chose Zoya as the one, why? I love her but she sure as hell can't handle that power with so much hate, and does not have the grace and control one needs to be chosen as the worthy one. Why not Nina? She's wiser, more cunning, less prone to recklessness, and generally more of a queen. I don't understand how Zoya was \u201cthe one\u201d? (hide spoiler)]\nOn criticisms about the ending:\n (view spoiler)[people say the Darkling's death had been final and his return didn't fit; I disagree\u2014the darkness in Nikolai couldn't simply vanish, bc it was merzost like the Fold. And if Aleksander had died the Fold wouldn't have disappeared. Actually, I'd predicted the main plot of this book (the darkness returning, Nikolai traveling, a witch deceiving him to resurrect Aleksander) as I'd believed that this mess with parem needed the Darkling to be solved. (hide spoiler)]\nStorytelling\n\nEveryone mourns the first blossom. Who will weep for the rest that fall?I will remain to sing for you, long after the spring has gone.\nBardugo's prose is elegant, beautiful, brilliant, and strong, with flowing dialogue and artfully chosen vocabulary. She amazed me with her intrigue, unique scheming, and how she included the contrary ideas and beliefs by bringing in Yuri, a smart scholar that, with logic, questions what our characters believe in.Along with all that, there was the idea of \u2018the divine\u2019 and how to manipulate the fear of power and difference, with the insinuation that there could be desperation behind it, or that it's true based on how you define \u2018divinity\u2019. The concept of \u2018Saints and magic\u2019 reminded me of \n Shadow Scale\n. Now, I hate comparing, but what she discussed didn't quite match the philosophizing Rachel Hartman achieved in her YA novel.\nCharacterization\nNikolai (POV): cunning, genius, observant, and talkative; I'm proud of his strength, his dedication and devotion, and his compassion. My adoration for him only grew when he questioned his own arrogance and desire for the throne. He pays attention to his people and listens to them, which is the best quality a king can have. One point to Bardugo for getting the qualities of a good leader right, here if nowhere else.Nina (POV): starting from a place of despair, she's still not helpless or clueless. And as the story processes, she becomes even more admiring. I doted on Nina in the SoC duology, and at the beginning of KoS she isn't fully herself, but she is better for it. She is an apt pupil (if Kaz could see her, he'd be proud of his \u2018Nina, dear\u2019) and she moves past hatred and prejudices and proves what a queen she is. Because THAT'S what it means to be a glorious strategist and a leader. Not what Zoya is.Zoya (POV): let's settle this; I admire Zoya. And I loved her in Ruin and Rising. And I love her strength and how we learn more of her past. I love angry characters, but I'm not blind to the fact that she's bitter, angry, rash, and full of hate. But everyone appears to be.Imagine loving a YA Fantasy, then see it an award for Best Adult Fantasy. Everything and everyone has their place, and Leigh was passing Zoya as something she wasn't. \u201cShe was maturing into a steady, confident leader.\u201d SHE'S NOT. Everyone is so in love with Zoya that they are ignoring an important matter; \nanger, hate and recklessness are NOT good characteristics for a leader!\nAnd as someone who has personally suffered under leaders with the same kind of arrogance, fury, and self-righteousness, I felt infuriated and insulted every time Leigh PROMOTED such behaviour and called her \u201calready a queen\u201d when she's nowhere near there. I love angry, vengeful characters (hence, Mare Barrow) and exploring that hatred because heaven knows I relate\u2014but only when it's actually treated as angry, vengeful behaviour and the character is called out on it.This is problematic. It's in no way an attack against Zoya. As I said, I do love her. But I'm saying she's not in control enough to handle the power Leigh is giving her, while everyone is pretending she is, and was chosen because of it.Also, she stole Nikolai's thunder. If Leigh had named this Queen of Storms (Zoya Duology, #1) I'd have known what I was getting into and wouldn't have been played for a fool. And I hate being lied to for publicity. It felt like someone had forced her to write a Nikolai story (which isn't unlikely).Isaak (POV): my saviour! When I was a little done with how \u2018holier-than-thou\u2019 Zoya is, or how obsessed, in need, and in love Nikolai was, there were Isaak's chapters to save the day with their hilarious intrigue and their adorable romance.\n\u201cWe begin in darkness, and it is to darkness we return. Where else are the rich man and the poor man made equal? Where else is someone judged for nothing but the purity of his soul?\u201d\n\nYuri:\n no one can deny his character served to add more credibility to Bardugo's tale with how he represented the not-all-evil people that, through logic, believe in taking any measures and doing anything in the name of the greater good. He is an interesting and complex character, smart and, besides his questionable motives, also raises questions about the hierarchy and is a true scholar and believer. I loved his belief and genius.\nRelationships\n\nNikolai's romance:\n in one sentence can I summarise everything I felt about this turn of events: it is as forced as relationships come. I love both of them, but I don't like this ship. Don't like the winds filling its sails or the waves guiding its way. She doesn't respect him. Says she loves him and obeys him as her king, but whenever they disagree, his opinion is to her nothing more than a mere inconvenience that she'll just walk on. I mean, he's your KING. Not your five-year-old brother that doesn't understand anything! So I'm not gonna ship my precious Nikolai with someone who doesn't even respect him. I don't want him to turn into this PATHETIC clueless man\u2014not unless she changes.\nNina's romance:\nI'm emotional. Everything Leigh failed to do with Nikolai, she more than made up for in Nina\u2014when Nikolai's romance annoyed me, Nina's filled me with gratitude. I started this wanting Nina as queen (still do). But this line of story for Nina is beyond exquisite.\nIsaak's romance:\n is it too obvious I'm a weeping mess? *turns head around, sniffles, cleans eyes with a handkerchief, turns back around* the cutest, most hilarious doomed love EVER.\nWorldbuilding\n\n\u201cThe Ravkan people like their leaders with just a touch of the unseemly about them. They don\u2019t trust a man of too much virtue.\u201d\nWhat I appreciate the most in high fantasy novels is not the magic, but the building of societies, because the trick of building a whole new world is paying attention to the most fundamental things that make up each world, and the cultures we belong in are one of the most important ones. In KoS, Bardugo flawlessly built that identify for a nation and its people.Grishaverse magic system, now, is one of the best ones I've read yet, but in KoS we learn things about it that just kind of destroy the whole beauty of the Small Science\u2014giving the well thought-out magic system the sense that it's the product of a teenager's unorganized brainstorming.What do I mean? (view spoiler)[Before, we learned how hard Morozova had worked to master all the elements, how special he had been, and I'm not saying it means no one else can do it (and I understand that Zoya is strong and could do it) but it was just stupid to just have Juris say \u201cHey sup. D'you know there's no limit to your powers? By the way, how about a sword fight? I'm feeling rusty!\u201d and then...poof. She has mastered it. Srsly, WTF? (hide spoiler)]And the concept of magic depending on faith reminds me of  Emperor of Thorns. Again, it was mentioned in passing in KoS and didn't rival Mark's extraordinary work in EoT\u2014more like Leigh just name-dropped the most amazing ideas, but failed to do anything with them.All in all, genius yet disappointing. I just no longer know what to do with myself.\nCompanions\n\nBooks in series:\n1) King of Scars \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\u26062) Untitled Sequel \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\nBook playlist:\n Spotify LINKRelated books: (publication/reading order)\u2022  Shadow and Bone (Shadow and Bone, #1)\u2022  The Tailor (Shadow and Bone, #1.5)\u2022  Siege and Storm (Shadow and Bone, #2)\u2022  The Demon in the Wood (Shadow and Bone, #0.1)\u2022  Ruin and Rising (Shadow and Bone, #3)\u2022  Six of Crows (Six of Crows, #1)\u2022  Crooked Kingdom (Six of Crows, #2)\u2022  The Language of Thorns: Midnight Tales and Dangerous Magic (Grishaverse)", "num_likes": 155, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["romance", "politics", "lgbt", "fantasy", "young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2322198688", "review_id": "2322198688", "date": "Feb 05, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Cait (Caitsbooks)", "user_url": "/user/show/26144369-cait-caitsbooks", "text": "Overall: 5/5 StarsCharacters: 5/5Setting: 5/5Writing: 5/5Plot and Themes: 5/5Awesomeness Factor: 5/5Review in a Nutshell: King of Scars absolutely blew me away.

Who will grieve the rest who fall?\u201d - Premise -King of Scars is the first book in a new GrishaVerse duology, following Nikolai Lantsov, the King of Ravka, his general, Zoya Nazyalensky, and a soldier in his army, Nina Zenik. This is the most I can say without spoiling any other GrishaVerse books, however beyond this point I\u2019m going to stop caring about spoilers for the Six of Crows Duology and The Grisha Trilogy. If you haven\u2019t read those books-- READ THEM! Not only are the amazing, but they are definitely required reading for King of Scars. There is so much going on in this book, and you really should read the first five books in this universe (and probably The Language of Thorns too because why not), otherwise it may get a bit confusing, and some of the emotional moments may not hit quite as hard as they would if you knew the full context. While it *technically* isn\u2019t mandatory, it really should be. \u201cIt's not exciting if nothing can go wrong.\u201d - Writing - Leigh Bardugo has definitely earned her title of queen of YA fantasy. Her writing style is gorgeous, with elegant prose and so many beautiful, quotable lines, while also having so many funny and snarky lines that I absolutely adored. She manages to both tug on your heartstrings and make you laugh. Although, perhaps that may not be the best way to describe the emotional rollercoaster this book is. She steps on your heart with 5-inch stilettos and still has you eager to start the next chapter.\u201cIf men were ashamed when they should be, they'd have no time for anything else.\u201d - Plot -There is quite a bit happening in this book. With 2-3 plotlines going on at any given time, there is always something exciting happening in someone\u2019s point of view. The beginning can be a little slow, as you're seeing this world again for the first time in years and a reintroduction is in order, but once the pace picks up, it never slows again. This book is filled with  political maneuvering, spying, deception, and epic action.\u201cZoya of the lost city. Zoya of the garden. Zoya bleeding in the snow. You are strong enough to survive the fall.\u201d - Characters - I love these characters more than anything. Most of the characters are familiar faces, seen in previous books (which is why it\u2019s so important to read those), but there are also a good amount of new characters that will steal your heart. Isaak became a favorite of mine after just one chapter. Yuri was another character that captured my attention. Seeing him interact with the main characters who lived through Ravka\u2019s civil war was always fascinating. Hanne was another new character, and I can\u2019t wait to see more of her! As for the old friends we all know and love-- this book made me love them all even more. Nikolai is just as amazing as always. I wish Leigh would just let him be happy for once in his life, but apparently, that\u2019s not allowed. It was so great learning more about Zoya and her history and seeing her and Nikolai interact never failed to make me smile. Meanwhile, every Nina chapter broke my heart more and more. That said, her development in this book is handled so well, and while some scenes with her made me sob, I love her so much. Most of the side characters from The Grisha Trilogy also show their faces in this book, and I loved hearing how they\u2019re doing and where they ended up. I only wished we got to see some specific characters I loved, but hearing their names mentioned was good enough for me!\u201cHope was the wind that came from nowhere to fill your sails and carry you home.\u201d- Conclusion -Pros- Beautiful writing, every character is amazing, fun plotCons- I was such a mess after finishing it. That ending was cruelOverall- 5/5 stars. King of Scars is amazing. It is captivating, thrilling, heartbreaking, immersive, and every other adjective I can think of. You\u2019ll be seeing this in everyone\u2019s \u201cFavorite 2019 Releases\u201d at the end of the year (I know it\u2019ll be on mine). \u201dHe was a king who had only begun to make mistakes. He was a soldier for whom the war would never be over. He was a bastard left alone in the woods. And he was not afraid to die this day.\u201d ----- Initial Thoughts (2/5/2019) -----Im surprised I can even form words right now. This book was everything I wanted and more.

(I\u2019ll fight for Cersei Lannister to the death. Don\u2019t @ me.) Homegirl Zoya\u2019s character arc soared in this and I sat in the front row cheering her along the entire way.2. The witty banterI\u2019m positive Leigh Bardugo + all of her witty characters would be my best friends. Her characters love to use humor to avoid dealing with anything of importance AND OBVIOUSLY that is chapter 1 of my autobiography.3. The endingNOPE.

But that is not the only danger lurking. Strange things have been happening in Ravka, some call them miracles. And Nikolai had his own demons to face. My love for Nikolai is limitless, and gosh am I grateful that Leigh decided to write this story. It was so good to see old friends again like Genya and David (my otp), Tamar, Tolya, Nadia, Adrik and Zoya. Much like Six of Crows each chapter is a different POV. I will not mention who exactly but I loved getting to know each of these characters\u2019 dreams, hopes and backgrounds. Many readers were expecting something similar to SoC and were dissapointed. This is not a heist themed action packed book. This is about a group of people trying to save their country. So it was more in line with the original Grisha Trilogy.I appreciated the slower pacing in the first third of KoS. It helped me connect with these characters again and what's been happening in their lives since we last saw them and seeing as we've never read in (most of) their POV's before.

Nikolai's mind never ceases to amaze me. I love his plans and schemes and his charming humour. And even though he is confidant that he is the king that Ravka needs, the underlying despair he feels about the monster taking over kills me. But what killed me even more was getting to read about his childhood. How unwanted he felt and when he finally realised how cruel those in power are. But above all else, he did it because he knew he needed to rescue his country. Nikolai had to save Ravka from his own family.Nikolai's infinite patience with Yuri was maddening. I was totally on Zoya's side when it came to that nutter.

When I read the Grisha trilogy I never liked Zoya's arrogance and it used to annoy me how unnecessarily rude she is. I don't mind so much now. As a matter of fact... I fucking love it. I was listening to the audiobook whilst doing the dishes when I got to the story about her mom forcing her to marry an old man at the tender age of eight.

How did I become so attached to him in so few chapters? HOW? *cries*NinaNina had her own trials in Fjerda. She was a total badass saving that town. And I loved her chapters. Every reminder of the ending of Crooked Kingdom was a stab to the fucking heart. I know that a lot of readers are shipping Nina and Hanne. But I actually didn't like that a potential love interest made an appearance so soon. Key word: soon. It is too soon man. I am not over Matthias yet and I just can't think of Nina with anyone else....YET. I think Nina is equally brilliant and mad for going undercover once again to the Ice Court.

On a critical standpoint, King of Scars stands at 3 stars for me, but considering I\u2019ve had tons of fun reading it, the enjoyment rating is 4 stars. I think this might be my favourite Leigh Bardugo book. I mean I haven\u2019t read the Ninth House -which sounds incredible, but King Of Scars feels like a step up for her. The characters are more developed, the world building is expended and well exploded, the plot is politically centred but understandable. SYNOPSIS: King of Scars tells the story of Nikolai, the cynical prince we meet in Shadow and Bone and encounter again, briefly in Six of Crows. 3 years after the Darkling\u2019s death, something dark and twisted awakens in Nikolai as starts to turn into a blood-thirsty beast at night. Facing adversity and threatening coups, Nikolai\u2019s reign is under serious peril as he starts a dangerous journey to kill the beast inside him.\u27bd Zoya Nazyalensky: the commander of the Grisha Army and personal ego-check to his majesty, Nikolai Lantsov. \u27bd Nikolai Lantsov: His majesty the king of Ravka and local Jack Sparrow. \u27bd Nina Zenik: Corporalki who used to be part of the Six of Crows squad but is now a spy of Nikolai send to save Grisha in other kingdoms. The character building, as I said in the introduction was incredible. We\u2019ve been introduced to most of the cast in this book beforehand which mean we know a bit about them from before and Bardugo makes sure that the bits you know about them before aren\u2019t the only thing you know after. She brings in quirks, history, more focus on them so it doesn\u2019t feel redundant and it really doesn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. \n\u201cYou are the conduit, Zoya. You will bring the Grisha back to what they were meant to before time and tragedy corrupted their power,\"\nWhen Zoya shared her story I unexpectedly felt for her. She\u2019s infinitely complicated, I\u2019ll never understand her completely and I feed off that mystery. She\u2019s cunning but devoted to her country. She\u2019s cold but sensitive all at once. And it makes sense when you read her because it\u2019s Zoya. \n\u201cI\u2019d rather look at the thing squarely than let it catch me by surprise.\u201d\n  Nikolai was true to himself. Witty, ambitious, and confident Nikolai\u2026 Where do I start... Oh yeah, he\u2019s a beautiful boy and he deserves the world. I just want him to rest at some point, it feels like the guy hasn\u2019t had a good night of sleep since Siege and Storm and he deserves better than that. He\u2019s such a just king for someone so full of himself, but it makes sense because it\u2019s Nikolai as well\u2026 I longed for this type of character development. \n\u201cAll this time, she had wanted to believe that he was still with her, but it had been her voice all along, talking herself through the silence, forcing herself to do the work of living when all she wanted was to let go.\u201d\n Nina\u2019s heartbreak hit the mark for me with spot-on quotes, but she didn\u2019t impact me as much as Zoya and Nik did. Although I do like the blooming romance with Hanna, I think these two are quite opposite so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it develops later on.The only problem I have with the character building in this book is that Leigh Bardugo is inconsistent with its characters. For example, Zoya, who was a cunt in the Grisha trilogy is suddenly understandable and likeable when she was plain mean-girl Regina George before. But I think it can be partially excused by the fact that before then we didn't focus much on Zoya, and the perception we had of her was painfully altered by Alina's prejudices against the girl. Not only that but it also feels like Bardugo is trying to salvage whatever can be saved from the Grisha trilogy as she grows as an author, which is something I personally endorse. She can't change what has already been published but she can change what hasn't.  \n\u201cI\u2019d like to see if an excess of irony can actually kill a man.\u201d\n There\u2019s an incredible balance between our cast\u2019s sarcasm and Leigh Bardugo\u2019s natural fairytale-like writing style. It makes the story much more enjoyable for some reason.\n\u201cIn death, a man may become anything at all. The Darkling possessed great power and died grandly, sometimes that is enough.\u201d\n The worldbuilding was expended. It was everything I never knew I needed but got, nonetheless. I love the fact that they\u2019re going as far as to question the origins of magic. It gives the story a new depth and a much-needed fresh air to the world is brought up. There\u2019s only so much \u2018good vs bad\u2019 stories you can put on someone before they say enough. Bardugo also questions the mystification of one\u2019s death and existence, especially in religion which is another interesting aspect I want to see more off in the next book. I\u2019m also anticipating the wars because there seem to be 3 official wars ongoing and another against the Grisha species happening underground as well; I can\u2019t wait to see how Nikolai and Zoya survive that one. However, the plot wasn't that great. And I'm painfully aware of it. It felt as if Bardugo needed an excuse to write King of Scars. She scrapped what was left in the ashes of her concluded series, glued them together and called it a day. The problem seems to lie in the fact that the characters from different series and have different goals, therefore, Bardugo doesn't seem to know what plot could bring them together. She ended up going for a political intrigue, which I totally stand behind. It was intricate and entertaining but not well balanced through the characters as it didn't matter equally to their individual personalities.  The end was weird as hell. I wasn\u2019t expecting this book to take this turn because I thought it would focus more on the world\u2019s expansion but it seems to have taken a step back to the good old \u2018good vs bad\u2019? I don\u2019t know how to feel about that one yet because, spoiler alert, DADDY IS BACK.

A curse he must keep hidden because his reputation would not survive the truth.

A girl who has gone under a physical transformation to disguise who she is. You will remember Nina from the Six of Crows and the Parem drug that gives extra strengths and powers to the people who use it. A highly sought after and precious drug to control. A fascinating multi-layered plot that just keeps giving, despite flagging a little towards the end of the book.

I know I shouldn't but after Six of Crows I wanted to much to love this as much as what I did with that series, however I found it slightly boring.It had so much potential, so many well loved Characters and it got to a point of where I had o force myself to carry on reading. It started off strong, the first few chapters had me gripped and wanting more, the middle not so much, and then the last 100 pages were intense.I don't know how to word this but I'll try, we have four different POVs, three were easily connected, but Ninas story felt separate, and as much as I love my queen that is Nina it threw me off a bit. Towards the end I can see how this is going to play out in the next book.Especially after the ending I am intrigued, and I think if you enjoyed The Grishaverse you'll enjoy this, but I think I set the bar too high for myself.Full RTC when I'm feeling better :)04.12.2021 Re-ReadYep I still stand by my previous thoughts and rating, there's just something about this one that doesn't hit me in the same way as the other books, especially when it follows two of my favourite characters in the whole of the Grishaverse, I think during the re-read I definitely enjoyed Ninas story a lot more, and AFTER only just re-reading Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdoms I definitely picked up on wayyyy more which I appreciate. So maybe I should of done that previously?I'm intrigued going into Rule of Wolves and also intrigued how it's going to set up a new Six of Crows (apparently?)--------Are we all seeing this?!NIKOLAI...

This just wasn't good at all? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI feel like this book only works if you're a die hard fan of the grisha trilogy/six of crows and then it works only barely. It's not a book that can stand on its own. You need to have read other books by Bardugo to understand the world and its characters, otherwise it doesn't make any sense.It sort of continues on on important things that happened in other books and characters talk a lot about what happened in the past, like Nina mentioning Matthias 50 times in her first chapter. I get it, she misses him, it's changed her, but if you haven't read Crooked Kingdom or just don't care about it, you won't care about her sorrows either. And since she's like 33% of this book, you kind of want to care about her or you'll be bored to death. Past events aren't explained properly, but they're all this book's about, so it becomes hard to feel invested. There's no plot, there's no suspense. There are endless conversations on the Grisha world and how they're trying to save it, but god it's so boring. It's very .... theoretical almost? No action, no feelings, just characters talking about strategies and neighboring countries and that magic potion thing... The pacing is unbearable and the reason why I did not finish this. It literally made me fall asleep.In the grisha trilogy, Nikolai was my favorite character. He's great. Unfortunately, he's not really much in this? Sure he's there on the page, big parts are about him, but you don't actually see that much of him. It's as if there's a cardboard version of him standing there, with catchphrases coming out when you push a button. All of the characters don't feel very fleshed out. It's as if Bardugo was like 'Okay this is how they talk and this is their personality' and then let a computer write the book. The characters didn't come to life, they lacked warmth (or actual coldness, in Zoya's case). It didn't help that it was expected of us to know and remember all of the characters from the grisha trilogy/six of crows; it's hard to care about them when you can't remember who they are.I've mentioned this before in my Six of Crows review, but Bardugo's banter sucks. Sorry, but it does. It's incredibly unnatural and out of place. You'll have characters making snarky comments in completely serious moments where sarcasm is just out of place. It never properly fits in with the rest of the dialogue or event. The only thing they're good for are stand alone quotes on Goodreads, Tumblr or whatever. They're catchy and not that bad on their own, but in the book itself the 'banter' is awkward, stiff and just weird. The ending's just cheap. It's there so people will read the second book. That's it. (But then again, the world building has always been cheap in these books. Don't get me started again on her use of Russian and Dutch language/culture.) It doesn't surprise me that she's pulling these sort of things to make people interested in another book.This almost felt like fanfiction, like someone writing on because they missed the characters and the world and didn't want it all to end. Not because they wanted to write a good, substantial book that can stand on its own. Honestly, I could go on for hours about the things I didn't like. This whole book feels like it was written for fans who will love everything and anything Bardugo writes. If a new, unknown author had written this, no one would've loved this or even continued on after the first 60 pages.", "num_likes": 121, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["books-i-own", "dnf", "so-boring", "not-as-good-as-id-hoped", "trash", "wtf-was-this", "wont-continue-series"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2136154637", "review_id": "2136154637", "date": "May 06, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ashlee \u00bb libraryinthecountry", "user_url": "/user/show/7990992-ashlee-libraryinthecountry", "text": "The gates of hell are open, and the devil himself is here to play.I am crying.

I didn\u2019t think Leigh could do it. I wasn\u2019t sure she could pull it off. She kept teasing us and teasing us. WELL. THAT JUST HAPPENED FOLKS. Leigh just rocked the Grishaverse.

And Zoya is terrified of the things Nikolai makes her feel, but part of her wants to feel again. I need these two like a drowning man needs air.AND NINA MY GURL. MY ULTIMATE BESTIE. What has she gotten herself into!? First, the part with the Wellmother at the munition factory? YASSSS GURL GET IT. The dam part? INGENUOUS. But that ending? Nina is an apt pupil and SHE TOOK NOTES when she watched Kaz at work. Also - something is absolutely at work between her and Hanne and Leigh is owning up to her promises. The only thing that would make Nina\u2019s storyline better is if she calls upon some crows to bring all her scheming to fruition.Also - Isaak. Oh Isaak. His story was not one I had expected but it was such a breath of fresh air. I will say it - this book moved slowly. It was this tremendously long build up to an eruption at the end. I loved the clumsiness and lightheartedness of Isaak\u2019s chapters - until I didn\u2019t. Why you gotta do this to us Leigh? You\u2019re turning us into monsters while plucking all of the soft parts out of our hearts. WHAT A TRAGEDY.Finally. I am just reeling over what this means for the Grishaverse going forward.

First of all, if you haven\u2019t read the Grisha trilogy and Six of Crows duology then you should not begin here. Go get Shadow and Bone and start from there even though it is the worse of Bardugo\u2019s novels. It is important to know what happened before to fully enjoy this novel. More so, you need to already have some positive feelings for the characters in this novel because the pace is not great. The joy to spend more time with Nikolai and Nina made this novel worthwhile. I understand the book is meant to set the details for the 2nd novel but I felt underwhelmed after the excellent Six of Crows. Zoya was a pleasant surprise and she became my favourite POV. SPOILERS FFOR THE PAST BOOKS FROM HERE! There are 3 POVs in this novel. Nina is now in Fjerda, deep undercover as spy and her mission is to identify and rescue Grishas and take them to Ravka. She also wants to put Mathias\u2019 body to rest. The 2nd POV is the one of Nikolai. He has some sort of A dark monster inside him from when he was attacked by The Darkling. It is becoming stronger and together with Zoya, the King leaves on a mission to find a cure until it is too late. Zoya\u2019s POV was the most interesting because we get to find out more about her personality and why she was so unpleasant in the trilogy. Her evolution in this novel is also the most spectacular. MINOR SPOILER ABOUT THIS BOOK. I removed one star for the pace and I removed another star for the budding romance between a certain character and Nina. As many other reviewers, I found it way too soon after her loss and totally unnecessary. I felt it was put there only because she had to write a ff romance because she hasn\u2019t until then and Nina was the only one single.

I admit that all of Leigh Bardugo's books are slow paced (atleast I found them slow paced) but this book was something else. It took me 2 tries to finally complete this book. And I skimmed atleast 40% of the book. I just read it for Nikolai and Zoya and Nina and Genya and Isaak and David (no I'm not crying. you are). Fuck Hanne. I don't give a shit about her. Ok fine.

I can become a monster for him so that we can marry each other and live in peace under the rock I live and say fuck you to this cruel world because who wants to rule a country that's pure chaos anyways?(this is a joke. don't take this seriously). But I didn't really feel much for him. I mean I was sad about whatever was happening with him but I feel sad for almost everyone. Including me. And that girl who said reading is boring. Go figure.I LOVED Zoya and the thing that people sometimes call character development. She's a QUEEN. Of my heart.

Couldn't ask for more...at least that's what I thought before reading it the very first time. It turns out that there are more familiar characters from the trilogy in this one, and at least one appearance heavily affected my verdict about this book. \n'The monster is me and I am the monster.'\nThe Darkling may be gone, but some of his magic hasn't - Nikolai Lantsov, one true King of Ravka and Supremely Adorable Character Number One of the Shadow and Bone trilogy isn't a monster any more - that spell was broken. At least everybody thought so, until it turns out they were wrong. At night, the king who must heal his broken country turns into a demon that has to be supervised by his most trusted advisors to ensure that he doesn't murder his subjects. While Zoya and the other Grisha try to help him on his search for a cure, Nina Zenik is among her enemies. Heartbroken by the events of the most epic auction in Ketterdam's history (it's in Crooked Kingdom, in case you didn't know. Read that fucking book!), she has left for Fjerda, the land of the Dr\u00fcskelle who consider any Grisha as a witch waiting to be burned. Working undercover as a spy for Ravka, Nina tries to reveal the dark secrets of the Fjerdan military.\n'She wished she had Inej\u2019s gift for spywork or Kaz\u2019s gift for scheming, but she only seemed to have Jesper\u2019s gift for bad decisions.\u201d\n I loved Nina's story arc.  Once again, I could only marvel at how Leigh Bardugo manages to portray Nina's feelings, that overwhelming sense of loss and sadness. She really knows how to make her characters come alive. I also loved the first half of this book, all the intrigues of the Ravkan court, all of Nikolai's ingenuity, all of Zoya's sassy quips. Nikolai was better as a secondary character, I think, but his chapters were still an easy, entertaining read, mediating between his hopes for the country he loves and his fear of the demon inside. I never would've thought there could be something between Zoya and him, but Bardugo narrates their developing relationship as brilliantly as usual, and anyway, by now it seems to be something of a trademark of hers to make all of her characters fall in love with each other. \n'He plucked his wineglass from his abandoned dinner tray and drank it to the dregs. \"One day you will overstep and I will not be so forgiving.\"\"On that day you may clap me in irons and throw me in your dungeons.\" She crossed the room, took the glass from his hands, and set it on the table. \"But tonight it is you who wears chains.\"Her voice was almost kind.'\nZoya and Nikolai aren't a thing yet, but they're definitely on the way there. Speaking of on the way there: they were on the way to unravel the mystery of why there are so many strange things happening all over Ravka when the story suddenly turns for the worse. I love how you can never guess where Leigh Bardugo's stories go, but this time it was too much of 'Just whatever is happening here?' for me. That whole Saints plot was just...er, no. Too much, thanks. And once that part was over and we came for the ending - THAT THING happened. And I hate it! Why? Bloody hell, someone's returning who's supposed to be dead.  Dear authors, don't resurrect your characters! The only resurrection in the history of literature I was ever okay with was that of Gandalf. I'm definitely not okay with what's happened here. IF YOU KILL YOUR CHARACTERS OFF, LET THEM STAY WHERE THEY ARE. Because? Because once you've opened that particular box of chocolates, death loses its meaning for everything you write. The next time you kill somebody, I'll be like 'Whatever, maybe they aren't really dead. They'll come back.' So I won't be happy about a villain's death anymore, and I won't be particularly sorry about a beloved character's death any more - because there won't be a finality to it. Also, I think it's quite petty to bring back old characters - I think Leigh Bardugo is creative enough to write new, memorable characters.  So the ending pretty much felt like a punch in the stomach. However, this was still a far-above-average-book to me for the biggest part of it. I loved Nina's storyline, I loved Nikolai's and Zoya's banter, and I loved the Isaak plot. Five stars for that. Also, five stars for the writing as a whole. Leigh Bardugo remains my Queen of 3rd person narrators, thank you very much...but still, I really disliked what happened to Zoya and Nikolai in the second part. It was just too mad for me (I never thought I'd ever say that. Guess I'm turning into an adult. Maybe. Hopefully not.), and I really, really am not okay with that character returning, not at all. So...maximum three stars for that second half, which adds up to four stars, I guess. Oh, and can I have the sequel already? Please?\n'There had been a time when words had been the only place he could find solace. No book ever lost patience with him or told him to sit still.

This was definitely one of my most anticipated releases of the year and it has a lot of promise for what the future of the Grishaverse books will hold. Whilst I was reading it, I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of pride because I've been with these characters since the beginning and they've come so far and endured so many trials and challenges but come out of them stronger and more resilient.\n\"Hope was the wind that came from nowhere to fill your sails and carry you home.\"\n\n\nNote:\n\n King of Scars is definitely for fans of Shadow and Bone and Six of Crows. If you're not a fan, you probably won't enjoy it. If you haven't read the previous Grishaverse books, you probably won't understand what is happening as there are multiple references to them.The characters and the relationships between them were all perfect:  \u2606 Nikolai was just as smart, witty and generally awesome as he always has been. His inner battle with the monster inside him was very well done.\"He might never be a truly noble man or a truly noble king... But he knew this much: He would not rest until his country could too.\"\u2606 Zoya was AMAZING. She was the most interesting by far and we got to learn so much more about her. She also had the most character progression thoughout the novel. The fancy dragon powers she got from Juris were pretty cool too. She is one of my favourite characters now.\"Stop punishing yourself for for being someone with with a heart. To live is to grieve.\"\u2606 At first, I didn't think Zoya and Nikolai would go together but as the book progressed I could see how much they trust and understand each other so I am now a staunch Zoyalai shipper!\u2606 I adored Nina. She was just as fabulous as she was in Six of Crows. I felt so sorry for her though especially when she buried Matthias (I almost cried) but I did love how Trassel (Matthias' wolf) found Nina again! I could tell her emotional wounds were still raw and in this book I could tell she still wasn't ready to confront those scars, heal them and learn to move on but I really hope she manages to find her peace in the next book.\u2606 Hanne was an awesome character but I don't ship her with Nina. I think it's because I still haven't gotten over Matthias' death yet.\u2606 Yuri was very weird and I can't believe they trusted him. Why would anyone worship the Darkling? It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard especially after all the harm he caused.\u2606 Genya and David were perfection (as always). Isaac was so sweet and he deserved better!The whole return-of-the-Darkling plot twist was brilliant and terrifying at the same time. I always thought that the ending of Ruin and Rising didn't feel like the end of the Darkling's story. I am anticipating in horror what despicable deeds he will do in the next book.I adored King of Scars yet I gave it four stars. Why? Because I felt like nothing much happened. The plot was very slow and the only interesting things happened in the last 100 pages of the book. Moreover, Nina's story line and Nikolai's felt very disconnected and I have no idea how Bardugo will manage to fit in so much into the next book and connect the separate plots.Overall, I loved this book and I'm so excited for the next chapter in the Grishaverse.

The hype was real, countless of fans had been dying for a Nikolai book since ever, and oh boy, are we disappointed. Because where is Nikolai's book? Is this, whatever this is, it? How is Nikolai not the protagonist of his own book? And if you tell me that the book isn't only his I'm going to throw my hardcover copy in your window because I am done, the frustration is too much and if Zoya gets a pass for being a rude person 24/7, well, so do I. But I gotta give it to Zoya, she is less this time around, almost as if she got tuned down for the role of the love interest that does not fit her. Anyway... I feel like random things were thrown together for this book and accepted because of its sequel.The first two chapters fooled me, there was so much potential and it was a great start. It set the tone for the book: Nikolai and his fight against his demon. But soon enough I realized that the first chapters were too good to be true, that the tone was a mislead, because I have been misleading myself. Nikolai and Zoya's plot got progressively worse while Nina's got better, and by the end of the book I was dreading whatever foolery would happen to Nikolai and Zoya while at the same time being delighted with the twists on Nina's chapters. There was clearly more investment from the author's part on one plot while winging it with the other. Leigh is a capable writer, we all know that, but her lack of interest for this book can be noticed. Either she was being lazy or didn't care enough about it, the end result was a mess. Magical rules that she had set for her world were ignored, the plot devices were ridiculous. Bees? Really? Was she reading The Raven King when writing this and thinking \"a giant hornet? what an espectacular idea\" and then proceed to write something just as dumb? Not much made sense in this book and the things that made sense before were brushed off. The book went from having an interesting premise to fillers upon fillers to get to the grand plot device of them all, the resurrection of the Darkling.And this comes from someone who absolutely loves him, who has him as her favorite character, but the Darkling should've stayed dead. Can authors, please, own up to their character's death? When a character dies and is brought back to life it takes away all of the emotional impact. It's meaningless. And is even worse when is done out of fan service. Because let's face it, it is. But not only did Leigh brought back the Darkling but she had to scold us while doing it. She had to shade us in every way she could. Be it from a quote calling us fools, or a cult plot in which every person seemed delusional or something else just as conceited. Listen, yes, the Darkling was terrible. He was a villain. But you shouldn't mock your readers for enjoying a character for its complexity, a character you wrote. That did not sit well with me throughout the book. But in the end for better or worse she brought him back, in the most uncreative way she possibly could. And worse, in the process of doing that she sacrificed Nikolai's story. The book that should be his and bears his name was anything but his, and in the end it dawns on you that the Darkling was not the plot device, Nikolai was.At some point, a random character named Isaak got his own chapters. It came out of nowhere, 3/4 in the book. We did not get his chapters before, there was no background, no reason why we should care for him. And by the time Isaak was having a talk with the Shu princess and possible future wife of Nikolai, I felt sad. Because there I was, reading this random dude (no offense to Isaak, he was a stand up guy) doing all the things that Nikolai should be doing were he not preocupied in being stranged in a castle made of sand waiting for the oportune moment to serve his purpose. Isaak did all the politics, the courting, the attempted assassinations... And when Nikolai got back and cleared the air, I felt super sad again because there was so much potential not explored for him in this book. Instead he wandered around, doing what feels like nothing, just wasting time and development. And is worth noting that Zoya was with him all along and how Nikolai did not had scenes with another woman in the whole book, maybe the author really wanted us to buy into his relationship with Zoya. But to me they are not compatible, and only one short moment Nikolai had with another character was enough to scream that. No matter how much time he spends with only Zoya, how many \"banters\" they have, it all feels too flat, there is no chemistry, there was no real development. Yet another thing in which the author did not tried at all.I am very upset about a lot of things, but mostly I'm sad for Nikolai. He is such a great character, he deserved better than this.The star is solely for Nina. Her plot was great, the side characters were great.

Readers should ideally have read both the original SHADOW AND BONE trilogy and the SIX OF CROWS duology before picking up this book; there are a lot of references to prior events and previously introduced characters. We return to the country of Ravka, setting of Shadow and Bone, where Nikolai Lantsov is now king. His efforts to mend the major rifts and problems that trouble his country internally, and strengthen it against foreign invaders, are endangered by a lingering curse from the Darkling that has begun manifesting again in recent months. On many nights, Nikolai transforms into a winged, bloodthirsty demon, terrorizing the countryside.Zoya Nazyalensky, his beautiful but caustic Grisha general, and his loyal servants have been protecting Nikolai\u2019s secret and chaining him at night to his bed, but the demon within him is growing in strength each day. It\u2019s only a matter of time before someone is killed by the demon. Strange but disturbing miracles in various places in Ravka, and the appearance of a young monk, part of a cult that worships the Darkling, lead Nikolai, Zoya and their friends on a journey to seek a way to permanently defeat the demon lurking within Nikolai.In the meantime, a group of three Ravkan Grisha is on a spy mission in the neighboring enemy country of Fjerda, a place deeply hostile to Grisha. They\u2019re searching out Fjerdans who have Grisha powers and are smuggling them out of the country. One of these Ravkan spies is Nina, the Grisha Heartrender with deadly powers from the SIX OF CROWS duology, who is still mourning the loss of her Fjerdan lover Matthias. Nina and her two cohorts head toward the Fjerdan town of G\u00e4fvalle to investigate rumors of curses and poisoned rivers, and find a hidden conspiracy festering in an old factory outside of the town. But what can three Grishas do against so many enemies?King of Scars is a clear step above the original SHADOW AND BONE trilogy: better written, more intense and much more creative. It doesn\u2019t reach the heights of the SIX OF CROWS duology, though my judgment on that may change once this Nikolai story arc is wrapped up in the second book, yet to be published (or even named). King of Scars is fairly fragmented in its plot: the two main story arcs never tie together in this volume, and there\u2019s a rather odd section in a desert palace in another dimension that I was never entirely on board with. And after a powerful start the narrative drags somewhat in the middle before picking up again toward the end. I didn\u2019t have any trouble putting it down a couple of times for a day or so, but there was never any question in my mind about whether I would finish the book.The best chapters in King of Scars are truly powerful. Zoya has been a Mean Girl in the prior books, but as her personality, her strengths and weaknesses, unfold in this novel, she becomes a sympathetic character who we can root for. Her devotion to her country and her king, Nikolai, is admirable and tinged with an attraction between the two of them that both hesitate to act on, seeing the futility of a relationship between them. Her story arc is marked by a heart-wrenching flashback chapter that reveals key events and relationships in her past, why she is the person she is. Like Nikolai, Zoya has both external and internal scars.After all this time, she still had not found an end to her grief. It was a dark well, an echoing place into which she\u2019d once cast a stone, sure that it would strike bottom and she would stop hurting. Instead, it just kept falling. She forgot about the stone, forgot about the well, sometimes for days or even weeks at a time. Then she would think Liliyana\u2019s name, or her eye would pause on the little boat painted on her bedroom wall, its two-starred flag frozen in the wind. She\u2019d sit down to write a letter and realize she had no one to write to, and the quiet that surrounded her became the silence of the well, of the stone still falling.Nina\u2019s plotline involves a group rescue mission against extremely long odds, and a more personal rescue mission as she grows close to Hanne, a rebellious young woman lodging at the same G\u00e4fvalle convent where Nina and her friends are staying. Hanne is hiding secrets of her own from her family and friends. It seems clear that there\u2019s a romantic attraction slowly growing between Hanne and Nina, which I found a little disconcerting, especially coming on the heels of Nina\u2019s deep mourning for Matthias and a tearjerker of a scene where she finally lays his (magically preserved) body to rest.King of Scars ends with a surprise twist that I found equal parts frustrating, intriguing, and horrifying.

I've been feeling weirdly uncomfortable since I finished the book and I have realised why.I think I discovered why it felt so much like Nikolai was being sidelined in this book. See, I have a theory that while she was in the process of writing this book, Leigh Bardugo fell utterly and hopelessly in love with Zoya Nazyalensky. So much so that the final product of this book became so much less about Nikolai and so much more about Zoya. And for somebody like me, who was fully expecting a book about Nikolai, it left me oddly unseated and almost cheated in a way.Listen. I adore Zoya Nazyalensky. She's a wonderful character and a well-written heroine. But she was not supposed to be the main character of this book, and I'm sorry but she's not exactly the perfect potential leader of Ravka that Bardugo paints her to be. She's an excellent war general, fitting for what her original position was supposed to be, but she has far too much anger and hate, and allows it to cloud her judgement too much, to be an effective, fair and justly-ruling 'queen'. She's an anti-heroine - and a wonderful one at that - but the problem stems from the fact that Leigh Bardugo appears to be setting her up to become a ruler of Ravka. And before she can be that, she first needs to deal with controlling her anger. And the problem there is that Bardugo hints that we're supposed to believe that Zoya's anger and hate is what makes her a good ruler. It doesn't. Nobody ever calls her out on allowing her fury to get the better of her, on ignoring the express orders of her king and defying him in almost every aspect. In fact, she's celebrated for it. Again, I love Zoya as a character. This is in no way meant to be an attack.And - once again - this book was supposed to be about Nikolai. Nikolai's journey and Nikolai's struggles. I'm not saying he should be the only character the narrative focuses on, but I am saying that, for a character who is literally the title of the book, it felt like he became a side character in his own story. I truly do think that Leigh Bardugo set out to write a book about Nikolai, but became too obsessed with Zoya. And that would have been fine if the book had been marketed as a Zoya book, or even an ensemble book like Six of Crows, but this was supposed to be Nikolai's book. He was sidelined enough in the Grisha Trilogy. Now he's being sidelined in his own damn book.Maybe I'm too clouded by my love for Nikolai as a character, who knows. I just can't help feeling misled.I'm sticking with the 4 stars because I'm too emotionally invested to lower the rating lol. But I just wanted to explain why I've been feeling so bothered since finishing this book and also maybe give a heads up to others like me who are going into this expecting a different story than the one they're getting.Original review:\"Re\u2019b Ravka, they said. Korol Rezni. Son of Ravka. King of Scars.\"Maybe you weren\u2019t able to tell from my frantically adoring updates but I AM PATHETICALLY IN LOVE WITH NIKOLAI LANTSOV!!!! Korol Rezni, the boy king, literally owns my entire ass\u2026 Like I would honestly lie down on a bed of hot coals and let him walk across me. I have never loved any character more than I love my hilarious golden-hearted scheming privateer king and he was WONDERFUL as always in this book. However I also feel like there wasn\u2019t actually enough of Nikolai?? Like, since the beginning this book has been marketed as A NIKOLAI BOOK but there were points in the story where I felt like my boy was being sidelined a little bit. I think some of it had to do with the fact that in the Grisha Trilogy he was an active part of the plot, whereas here he felt sort of more passive (until the last 50 pages or so). By that I mean that it felt like things were happening TO him, rather than him MAKING things happen. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense? I think I wanted more of his political scheming, which we got at the very end but was absent for a lot of the book (for a spoilery reason that I\u2019ll talk about in a bit).BUT I still absolutely love and adore Nikolai Lantsov and would legitimately die for him. We learn more about his childhood in this book and let me tell you I want to punch every single person who lived in the Grand Palace during Nikolai\u2019s childhood because he was a wonderfully bright child who was utterly ignored by his family which made him misbehave and act out and I just want to hug him. But JOKES ON THEM because my boy is a king now yeah he showed them all.So moving on from Nikolai for a moment, another character I absolutely adored in this book was Zoya. I love her POV and she\u2019s probably made it to my list of favourite heroines ever. (Yeah I prefer her to Alina lol). She has changed quite a bit since the events of the Grisha Trilogy (in fact, so much so that it almost felt like her personality had been just slightly retconned? But I appreciate we\u2019ve got the added factors of it being a long time since then, and also we\u2019re seeing inside her mind for the first time so of course we now have a different perspective.) My girl doesn\u2019t take any shit from anyone, not even the king, and holy shit she\u2019s powerful. (view spoiler)[If she doesn\u2019t turn into a dragon at some point in the next book I will riot. (hide spoiler)] Zoya Nazyalensky has some major big dick energy.Also, I absolutely adore the fact that 90% of Nikolai and Zoya\u2019s relationship can just be summed up with her saying something mean and Nikolai responding with the heart eyes emoji. My boy is so whipped for Zoya and I love it and YES I SHIP IT TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. Goddamn slow burn angsty romances hit you just where it hurts. Unfortunately I found some pacing issues associated with Nina\u2019s POV. I love Nina and I loved seeing the continuation of her story (as well as all the references to the Crows...man I miss them) but her chapters definitely felt a lot slower than Nikolai and Zoya\u2019s. It didn\u2019t help that her plot was almost entirely divorced from the main storyline, so much so that it almost felt like Nina\u2019s POV was taken from a different book altogether. I did really like her relationship with Hanne and I ship it so much, but I do hope Nina\u2019s story ties in more to the main plot in the next book, because I think it was detrimental to the pacing of the book.A few spoilery thoughts below:(view spoiler)[So just to get it out of the way, no I am not in any way shape or form a Darkling stan but yeah I guess I\u2019m a little excited about his coming back. My main issue with it is that it felt like his ending was final in Ruin and Rising, so bringing him back feels the tiniest bit disingenuous. Also I can just tell that all the bloody fangirls are going to be talking about the Darkling and taking the spotlight even more away from my golden son Nikolai. Lol I don\u2019t give two shits about the Darkling if it means that Nikolai\u2019s going to be relegated to the sidelines AGAIN, like my boy deserves all the love okay.I didn\u2019t know if I liked the whole storyline with the Saints at first but I think it\u2019s grown on me since. I really liked the stuff with Juris and Zoya and I really cried a lot during the scene where he took her to Novokribirsk. However I think it was a preeeeetty bold move on Bardugo\u2019s part to make the Saints canonically real, because it sort of warps the whole mythos of the series. One of the things I really liked about these books was that it was left ambiguous whether the religious figures were real or not, and you as a reader could really decide what you wanted to think. Also now it makes the Grisha seem more godlike and fantastical than they were before. And I don\u2019t think that sits very well with me, particularly because we\u2019ve got people like Nina and Zoya who sort of hint that they think Grisha are superior to normal people. But again, I think I\u2019m more open to the whole Saints stuff than I was when I first read it, mostly because it\u2019s probably gonna make for a super interesting storyline in the next book.ALSO I don\u2019t know why more people aren\u2019t talking about the fact that Nikolai heavily implied he wants to eventually dissolve the Ravkan monarchy and install what sounds like an elected government? Because it actually makes so much sense that Nikolai would think hereditary monarchies are a bad idea, since he isn\u2019t actually a Lantsov but earned his place on the throne, and his brother who WAS a Lantsov wasn\u2019t fit to rule Ravka at all (and neither was his father). I hope Bardugo follows through with this because it would be a SNAPPING power move for a YA fantasy author to dissolve her fictional monarchy.Also, it\u2019s sort of off topic but, now that Nikolai has made a deal with the Kerch, I\u2019m sort of hoping that\u2019s opening the possibility of Kaz making an appearance in the next book lol. Look I just want my boys Nikolai and Kaz to be bros okay because I think they will get along (and they developed a mutual respect and admiration when they met I\u2019M JUST SAYING.) (hide spoiler)]Overall I was guaranteed to enjoy this book because, well it\u2019s Bardugo, and the love & light of my life Nikolai is in it. BUT it wasn\u2019t a 5 star read. I think there\u2019s probably going to be more political scheming in the next book (view spoiler)[(especially because of all the Princess Ehri stuff, which is also gonna provide some good Zoyalai angst) (hide spoiler)] which is what I love the most. But I still adore this world & these characters and really did enjoy this book.All hail the boy king, the Korol Rezni.

It probably won't work, but at least I tried.Let's see. What's the best part of this book? Probably the characters. As usual.There are three main points of view: Nina, Nikolai, and Zoya. There's also Isaak, but he's just a side character who gets a few chapters. Nina Zenik, the waffle queen  \"I don't like that word. Call me Grisha. Call me zowa. Call me death, if you like.\"Needless to say, Nina was amazing. Because how could she be anything but amazing?I knew that Nina's POV was going to be depressing, at least for a time. I did not, however, expect a major crying session over one of her scenes. Because that happened. It was ridiculously painful, and I don't think I'll ever recover.I don't know what to say. I'm going to cry again.Nina is just such a strong character. I admire her confidence, and I just want her to be happy. *crying*Nikolai Lantsov, the king of Ravka and my latest fictional crush (no, I am not cheating on Kaz)\"I like to bet on myself whenever I can. But usually with other people's money.\"Kaz and Nikolai would be best friends, and you can't convince me of otherwise.Besides the blonde hair, Nikolai is my favourite type of character. Sarcastic, overconfident, but actually dying inside.*chef's kiss* perfection.Despite this being Nikolai's series, I think Zoya actually got more character development that Nikolai. Don't get me wrong, Nikolai had development, I just thought Zoya had more.I don't know what else to say. What's there to say about a perfect character besides \"he's perfect?\"There's nothing.I love Nikolai.This isn't helpful.Zoya Nazyalensky, aggressive, sarcastic bitch, and Grisha squaller (sort of)\"Hand me that brandy. I can't tolerate this degree of stupidity on a clear head.\"I liked Zoya in the Grisha trilogy, but my love for her has multiplied after reading this book.Perhaps that's because I relate to her.I think I relate to her a bit too much, which is problematic.I, too, hide my depression and insecurity behind a wall of insults and sarcasm. :)So, yeah, Zoya is super relatable. Also, an ultimate powerhouse. I mean, damn she's powerful.We love to see it.Now we get to the bad part. And by bad, I mean these parts killed me.Drumroll, please.THE SIX OF CROWS REFERENCES.*trying not to cry* The Six of Crows references were not okay.I'm pretty sure I recorded every Six of Crows reference in my updates, because I am obsessed with it. So what's the problem with these references?1. Well, it's taking all my self control not to reread Crooked Kingdom. These references totally shattered that control.2. You can't just mention Kaz without him being in the book. Because those mentions will make me wish that he was in the book or that I was reading Six of Crows.3. They give me flashbacks to the ending of Crooked Kingdom.So basically, the references killed me while also keeping me from dying of SoC book hangover.And then there's the romance, which is basically non-existent. There is no straight up romance. Just...romantic tension.You can tell that they care about each other, but the characters don't actually act on their feelings.Because this is a Leigh Bardugo book.And that's how the romance works around here.THERE'S NO POINT IN ROMANCE UNLESS THERE IS INTENSE PAIN AND LONGING.It's actually a nice change from the \"passionate kissing\" in other books.Or...other things. *glances nervously at ACOTAR and Empire of Storms*And finally, I don't know how to talk about the plot, okay? I just can't do it.As usual, there were a ton of plot twists at the end. I think I have whiplash. We aren't gonna talk about the ending because I don't need to trigger flashbacks.This is not a coherent review.I don't care.5/5 if Kaz isn't in the next book...don't test me.", "num_likes": 83, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["leigh-bardugo", "not-owned"]}, {"book_id_title": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_id": "58466929-el-rey-marcado", "book_title": "El rey marcado", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2378409678", "review_id": "2378409678", "date": "May 01, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Mary", "user_url": "/user/show/17156965-mary", "text": "THE GOOD:* lisTEN HERE, just to get this out of the way, Zoya is a Goddamn Queen\u2122 and she can walk all over me with stiletto heels and I\u2019d say thanks boo, u can do it any time* back when I read the Grisha trilogy, I wished for a Nikolai series and lo and behold, kids, dreams do come true, bless us all, praise to the heavens* this story went nowhere I expected it to?? * the sass and snarkiness (is this a word? idk i\u2019m using it, i don\u2019t give a fuck) and witty Nikolai Humour\u2122 is alive and thriving and I missed this Precious Boy* I cried in the first 100 pages, sue me* the ending felt like someone threw a punch at my head, while simultaneously throwing me off a cliff, yelling \u201cSURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER\u201d* in not so many words, I was positively shooketh* Nina\u2019s story arc made me feel alive and grateful to have eyes so I can read it* the writing is, as always, phenomenal, I need Leigh to write my obituary, so I would feel, at least as a ghost, that my life amounted to something* bless this book, pls read it, then come cry to me about it - you\u2019ll find me in a corner, still rocking back and forth two months after finishing this bookTHE BAD:* the only thing that I can think of was that Nina and Nikolai\u2019s stories felt like two different books, with no correlation between them, so at times I felt like I was reading two separate booksYAY or NAY: do\u2026 do you even need to ask?

You know what, a bit of consistency won't hurt anyone.(2) I had stopped noticing Bardugo's language problems altogether because whenever there are non-English words popping up in the text I just simply ignore it and I simply expect every 'foreign-sounding words' in her books to be incorrect and make-up out of thin air and disrespectful to the actually-existing languages because the woman seemingly wouldn't bother to use Google-Translator. But then Nastassja's Review informs me that 'Korol Rezni' from Russian means King of Massacre, not King of Scars (and I used Google Translator and it didn't take me more than one minute to find 'Korol Rezni' means 'King of Massacre' in Russian, and you know what I don't even know more than five words in Russian damn it). I'm still a bit shocked.....I mean, what kind of author can't get the correct Russian for her book title and her main character?(3) I'd gone through most of the book, I found this kind of story and characters have been done to death and done a lot better by countless Japanese adventure mangas before, I am not impressed.(4) Guess what? If you wanted to court a foreign noble girl, bothering her with poems which she had known all her life, is the right way to go, not trying to impress her by showing her sights only can be found in your own country or doing activities together.(5) Not to mention, said foreign noble girl mentioned at #4 came from a water-downed version of imperial China (or Mongolia), it's so water-downed that it looks really fake and forced.(6) Things are still predictable in King of Scars, so this guy turns out to be a traitor? But hasn't he been like, (view spoiler)[\"I worship the Darkling and think he is a saint\" (hide spoiler)] ever since day one!? (7) You know what? It's completely possible to be strong and kind at the same time. Cruelty and aloofness don't make you strong; plus being nice actually can help winning people to your side. But as usual, YA authors mistook mean girls with awful attitudes for the strong ones, and Zoya actually wants you to believe 'nice girls' are equated to 'weaklings'. I mean, can she just shove this back up her ass?(8) Don't get me wrong, I actually like Zoya better than that annoying Mary-Sue Alina both as a character and as Nikolai's love interest.(9) To be honest, I skipped all of the Nina's chapters (except maybe the first and the second chapter) I don't care about her development, I don't care, I just don't care. Her chapters are all deadweight.(10) As to the characters, I admit I am happy to see how Zoya, David and Genya are doing a few years later but as for Nikolai he and his struggling with his own demon and trying to save his country is just so damn boring. (11) To be honest, the last 30 or so pages are somewhat decent, but this good part of the story comes 'too little, too late', to a point that I only skimmed my way to the ending without bothering to read it word to word.(12) To sum up, it is a completely forgettable cookie-cutter YA novel with badly-put-together fantasy elements and paper-thinned characters trying to be oh-so-funny-and-witty all the damn time. Won't recommend to anyone.(12) Last but not least, bringing up the Darkling all the fucking times is so fucking tiring.

There were so many awesome little things in it that made the book wonderful. I loved Bardugo's writing all over again and the Snarkling (Nikolai) is alwaaaaaaays favorite of mine. I had forgotten some pretty big happenings also that I'm sure will matter for the next book. I'm so scaredexcited to see where the story goes next.This review was originally posted on  Books of My Heart\u00a0King of Scars is the first book in the new \n\nNikolai Duology\n\n by Leigh Bardugo set in the Grishaverse world. I\u2019ve read most of the books in this series apart from Language of Thorns and even though this is a new book in a series and you could read it without having read the other books set in this world, I think that you might miss out of some of the magic King of Scars has if you didn\u2019t know all of the history. Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll still be okay if you haven\u2019t read the other books Bardugo does a great job of reminding readers what has happened to all of the characters.This will be a little short because I don\u2019t want to give out spoilers for the previous series either. Nikolai is fantastic yet again. He is his charming, charismatic and optimistic self, most of the time that is, even though there is a demon slowly taking over his body. With Ravka on the verge of war yet again he has to pull his country and the rest of the world together. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure you\u2019re trying to frighten me,\u201d said Nikolai, reaching out a finger to touch the tip of the thorn. \u201dI\u2019m not sure why, but may I suggest a spider wearing a suit?\u201d\u201cWhy a suit?\u201d asked Zoya, frowning. \u201dWhy not just a spider?\u201d \u201cWhere did he get the suit? How did he fasten the buttons? Why does he feel the need to dress for the occasion?\u201d\n\nZoya, I remember well when I really hated that girl, has come full circle and she is just the bit of dry wit required for Nikolai to really play off of well. I love the team they make and could that be a little bit of forbidden love dangling in the air between them? *wink, wink* Well for me the sexual tension was palpable. Zoya is the general of the second army and Nikolia\u2019s most trusted friend and together they will try to find a way to purge the demon power left by the Darkling out of Nikolia before it takes him over completely.\n\nHe\u2019d come to recognize the bizarre phenomenon of Zoya\u2019s beauty, the way men loved to create stories around it. They said she was cruel because she\u2019d been harmed in the past. They claimed she was cold because she just hadn\u2019t met the right fellow to warm her. Anything to soften her edges and sweeten her disposition \u2014 and what was the fun in that? Zoya\u2019s company was like strong drink. Bracing \u2014 and best to abstain if you couldn\u2019t handle the kick.\n\nWhile Nikolia\u2019s PoVs are fantastic I was so happy to see Nina (from Six of Crows) again. After where we left her in that duology I was shattered, yes shattered is the best way to put it. She is just as strong and brilliant as she used to be and working as an undercover agent in Fjerda trying to save Grisha. I\u2019m just going to say that I have hope that a certain Fjerdian is not as lost as once thought, maybe naught will come from the beautiful imagery painted at an emotional goodbye in this, but Djel help us that this was really a beginning and not an end. \n\nBut before she could take a step, she saw them \u2014 five hulking shapes in the snow. Wolves. \u201dOf course,\u201d she said. \u201dMatthias, your country can kiss my fat Grisha ass.\u201d\n\nI loved being in the Grishaverse again and returning to the little palace. Seeing David and Genya along with Tolya and Tamar and even returning to some of the events with the Darkling made for such a great story. It was full of politicking and action and two separate but fantastic story lines. The first being Nikolia, his battle with darkness and trying to pull Ravka together and keep it out of yet another war. The other surrounded Nina and her fight to fulfill a promise made to the man she loves no matter the cost and to save the Grisha living and hiding is Fjerda.The end is not a cliffhanger but there were a few surprises and it looks set up to be a fantastic action packed finale by the looks of it.The Grishaverse is also coming to Netflix and I for one am so excited to see these stories brought to any size screen. \nNarration:\nLauren Fortgang did a wonderful job with all of the characters. \u00a0The best thing about listening to stories in the Grishaverse is the slightly Russian accent to many of the characters. \u00a0Lauren did them all well and it didn\u2019t matter if it was Nikolai\u2019s charm or Zoya\u2019s haughtiness or Nina\u2019s strength and vulnerability she performed them all spectacularly.Listen to a clip:https://soundcloud.com/audiolibrary-a...\u00a0\nSpoilerish Section\n(view spoiler)[Below will be unmarked spoilers for this book and all the others in the Grishaverse, enter at your own risk.Okay so Nina is in this book and first I was to say that I was so upset over Mattias\u2019s death in Crooked Kingdom that I made up an entire scenario in my head of how he isn\u2019t really going to be permanently dead. Did that come true? Well not exactly but I am holding out some hope that the big guy isn\u2019t forever gone.There are a few things in the book that I\u2019m going to call hints. One Nina keeps hearing his voice until they make it to the spot where he says it will be perfect to bury him. I totally want to believe that this is because his spirit was with her still. Two, the body isn\u2019t decaying like normal because it has been Grisha preserved not to since his death, I\u2019m thinking that might help him in the long run. Third there is that part I have been made to protect you. Even in death I will find a way. His voice was too clear now, too strong. Because this was their final parting. Because once Matthias was in the ground, he would belong to Djel.I think if there is a way to fight back from the other side Mattias might find it. There is also a moment when Nina thinks Lying in the well of the grave, Matthias \u2019 body looked like a chrysalis, as if he were at the beginning of something, instead of the end. and it is mused that in the Spring the snow will melt and carry Mattias\u2019s spirit to Djel. I\u2019m hoping that is when some sort of resurrection can occur for him. I\u2019m not giving up hope yet.For the rest of it Saints, I was not expecting that and dang the Darkling back again cannot be good for our posse in Ravka. Nikolai and Zoya together, I really hope this happens. I am a big fan of their dialogue and really she is the perfect counterpoint to his charming and optimistic ways. They definitely have the budding of a great relationship there except for that pesky little problem of him needing to wed someone else. But I think long term that will get sorted.But the Saints and how amplifiers were truly supposed to work was pretty amazing. I didn\u2019t see that stuff coming at all. Juris as a teacher to Zoya was great, finally someone she could not intimidate or bully, although with the stuff she learned she will be even more dangerous and scary than before.The monster inside Nikolai was really a conundrum and that did seem like the only way to get it out was what the Darklings Priest proposed. Still I kinda want him to learn to master it. I think it could come in handy long term and what girl doesn\u2019t love the story were her prince is also a monster. Because by the time you two have said your vows, you\u2019ll have charmed her into loving you, and then you\u2019ll be her problem to take care of.\u201d \u201cEven my charm has its limits, Zoya.\u201d If so, she had yet to encounter them. Zoya cast the king a disbelieving glance. \u201cA handsome monster husband who put a crown on her head? It\u2019s a perfect fairy tale to sell to some starry-eyed girl. She can lock you in at night and kiss you sweetly in the morning, and Ravka will be secure.\u201d \u201cWhy do you never kiss me sweetly in the morning, Zoya?\u201d \u201cI do nothing sweetly, Your Highness.\u201dAnd so we end with more enemies than we started with and all of our characters surrounded by enemies. The next book should be a whopper of a tale.

And if that's not a missed opportunity, I don't know what is. Their paths don't even cross ONCE. It was like reading two different books simultaneously, which meant the overall plot felt incohesive... \nPlot #1:\nNikolai, Zoya and Yuri, a Darkling-worshipper (don't ask), go on a quest to extract the shadow monster in Nikolai, which is getting stronger by the day. They leave behind Genya, David, Tolya, Tamar and Isaak, the latter who acts in the king's stead, to manage the parties (held in order to find a suitable queen) and other affairs in the Ravkan palace. Danger, complications, twists etc etc follow\nPlot #2:\nNina, Adrik and Leoni travel undercover to a village in Fjerda, for a reason I cannot mention, but they end up staying for another. There they meet one-heck-of-a-female called Hanne, and together they try to solve the mystery of what's happening in 'the Factory' that's posioning the river. Dangers, complications, twists etc etc followYou see? 2 stories.However... that's where my complaints end because I LOVED BOTH OF THESE ENGAGING STORYLINES SO MUCH. Leigh Bardugo has not lost her touch my friends, and I could not be gladder!! THIS BOOK WAS FANTABULOUS! And that's thanks to the CHARACTERS; I'm obsessed with every single one of them!! Some obsessions were newfound, some reignited and some never died out to begin with *ahem* Nikolai *ahem*. The character depth, arcs, dynamics and chemistry were incredible!!Oh and the DIALOGUE was even better than I had anticipated (and I knew this book had Nikolai in, so I expected A LOT!) The banter and wit exhibited by these characters had me smiling like mad.Observe:\n\nGenya's lips twisted into a smile. \"You're saying you've never wanted to kill Nikolai?\"(Zoya:) I\"Oh, I have. I just don't want him to sleep through it.\"(Nikolai:) \"You say exile, I say extended holiday.\"\"We should send him to Ketterdam to preach to Kaz Breaker and the rest of those reprobates,\" suggested Zoya.Nikolai winced. \"He'd certainly get his martrydom.\" \"The squash is as wide as I am tall,\" Nikolai said beneath his breath a be smiled and waved. (Zoya:) \"And twice as handsome.\"\"Half as handsome,\" he protested.\"Ah,\" said Zoya. \"But the squash doesn't talk.\"\n\n And speaking of Zoya and Nikolai I Sturmhond-SHIP them!! If their chemistry was taught I would've actually paid attention in lessons... That said, there's no actual romance between them (YET), just pining: \n\nIn that moment he wished things might have been different. That he might not [redacted] tomorrow. That he could be led by his heart instead of duty. Because Zoya was not kind and she was not easy. But she was already a queen.\"\n\n *shipper-heart screams*Now, I could continue to sing praises and keep you from reading this book. Buuut that could be considered a criminal offence since nothing should be allowed to keep you from picking up this must-read! Well...nothing except this final thing: \n\n\"Fear is a pheonix. You can watch it burn a thousand times and still it will return.\"\n\n a) What a beautiful quoteb) The same can be said for (view spoiler)[\n  the Darkling. Yes, he returns. Riiiiight at the end. Yes I am scared senseless...but also? excited?\n(hide spoiler)] and that's exactly why I can't wait for book 2._______________________________*Reads final page**Breathes into paper bag*Why Leigh Bardugo?

(watch my heart break repeatedly at his suffering. i shouldn\u2019t love this stuff so much ?? i\u2019m a masochist.) then we\u2019ve got two powerful female leads, which i will always eat up greedily. zoya, who might not be a (queen) but is, let\u2019s be honest, a queen, and nina, who was featured in the six of crows books, but who we got to know even better here. she is a master of her craft, at adapting to new situations, and at acting. i would take the sword for her (and although we definitely got to mourn matthias\u2019s death a bit more here, and i know that it\u2019s early, but\u2026potential romance with hanne ?? nina zenik is a bisexual legend, either way.) (i will also always laugh about the fact that she includes \u2018kaz brekker\u2019s heists\u2019 on the lists of things that she has survived.) at the beginning of any fantasy book or series, the world building can be a bit overwhelming. (what is going on here and what does any of it mean?) entering my sixth book in the grishaverse, however, i\u2019m now comfortable and familiar with this world. bardugo\u2019s world building is spectacular - and with that initial stumbling confusion left out of the way, i was able to focus all of my energy on appreciating the character development and fantastic plot twists.

I warned you. This is hella boring and most certainly not worth your time.\n\u2910 Overall.A very accurate depiction of me once I realised this book was bad and only bad:Seriously, that's a No from me, pal. Leigh's worst work so far. And I'm still being generous, mind you. Getting into the narrative of King of Scars was harder than getting into my least favourite pair of jeans when they're fresh out of the washing machine.If I had a euro for every time a famous author turned out to be a huge disappointment, I'd be a week's worth of salary richer. I've always enjoyed Leigh's work and made a point of being vocal about that whenever the opportunity arose, but this book made me adjust my opinion. Surely, the characters and their banter-filled dialogues are a joy but if the arch of suspense is about as flat as my heartrate when somebody suggests trying out scuba diving, there MUST be something missing, amiright?In all seriousness, long story short, apart from some slightly highlighted bits, this book was 500+ pages of wasted time, energy, money and dead trees.\u2910 What\u2019s happening.\n\n\u2018Do that thing you do where you use too many words to say something simple and confuse the issue.\u2019\n\nA summary of the effort Leigh thought might be appropriate to put into this book, in which we follow a couple of young/new adults (?) around Ravka, one of which is possessed, another is perpetually sour and yet another grieves the loss of a dude who - for the better part of their relationship - had nothing to do but feel comfy in his racial prejudice towards people with magic = her. Oh, and , of course,  the well-being of the kingdom relies on these three and a poor boy who's forced to impersonate the king-turned-monster whilst the true ruler is on some self-healing trip with some Saints and his female bodyguard he's secretly in love with. There, that's all and I didn't even spoil anything. No need to read the book._____________________3 STARS. Decent read that I have neither strongly positive nor negative feelings about.

King of scars.\"I still can't really believe that Leigh Bardugo decided to be a merciful goddess and grant the fans of her Grishaverse their biggest wish; a book about Nikolai. A book that will probably be just what everyone has been dreaming about. Taking place some months after Crooked Kingdom, we are finally reunited with Nikolai, Zoya and the rest of the Triumvirate. They're all busy trying to help Ravka heal from the damage done by years of war, something that is made harder by the threat of new war from all sides - even from inside the young king himself.Meanwhile, Nina Zenik is on a secret mission, desperately attempting to save Grisha like herself and hopefully recruit them to Ravka's Second Army. But recent events might have changed her in even more ways than she can imagine.First of all, King of Scars is probably everything that I could have wanted. Even though we started off a little bit slow - which I actually didn't mind at all - there was so much to love. We had familiar, loved faces that we get to know on a deeper level, along with more political intrigue, more heartstopping plot twists and that lovely banter which just helps bring out the characters and their personalities even more. Seriously, I love, love the way Leigh Bardugo writes dialogue - it has a flow and charm to it that I rarely see in other authors writing.I loved to see the characters develop, loved to see especially Nikolai and Nina deal with their past ghosts and trauma in a way that felt so utterly believable and that also tore my heart from my chest. Zoya too - I can't believe the way she has grown, while never trying to be anything other than the badass, almost anti-heroine that she is. The way they were all so vulnerable, while still managing to be strong... It felt realistic, and it felt empowering.\"He would not rest until his country could too. And he would never, ever turn his back on a wounded man - even if that man was him.\"Cue the tears.Bardugo just keeps on getting better and better in general, and even though my reigning favorite is still Six of Crows, this world she has created continues being filled with life, colour and history. She's doing amazing things with the Grishaverse, and I hopes she never leaves it completely behind. This is a world I need to keep on exploring. Especially after that ending. What. The. Fuck. The sequel is going to be insane.All in all, King of Scars is here to make us all swoon, scream with shock, crush on everyone in it and cry a bit.

Ed \u00e8 qui che scopro quanto abbia perso nel non leggere prima questa serie perch\u00e9 per quanto Fairy Oak sia una bellissima serie Middle Grade \u00e8 anche una storia che scalda il cuore, che ci fa sorridere, e che ci ricorda quanto fosse bello farsi raccontare da piccoli prima di andare a letto delle dolci storie come questa.Fairy Oak ha il dolce gusto della cioccolata calda, \u00e8 il caldo tepore del camino in una gelida serata invernale, \u00e8 una serata in famiglia quando fuori piove, \u00e8 il profumo di un giardino in fiore ma \u00e8 pi\u00f9 di ogni cosa la felicit\u00e0 e la semplicit\u00e0 custodita nel cuore di ogni bambino che l'autrice riesce a dipingere attraverso le due protagoniste della storia.Pervinca e Vaniglia sono due sorelle che si imbarcano nella grande avventura che \u00e8 la scoperta dei loro poteri magici ma quando tutto sembra essere normale nel buio tramano le forze del male che vogliono impossessarsi di Fairy Oak, il loro amato villaggio.La storia ci viene narrata seguendo il PoV della fata Fel\u00ec, una tata fata che ha il compito di vegliare sulle due ragazzine. Attraverso i suoi occhi ripercorriamo la storia delle due gemelline, del loro carattere vivace e spensierato e dalla loro scoperta della magia, dei poteri della Luce e della Notte.La storia della Gnone \u00e8 caratterizzata dal un worldbuilding studiato ma di facile comprensione, dalla costituzione del villaggio, dalla caratterizzazione della magia e di quei piccoli particolari che di volta in volta vengono introdotti per rendere la storia unica ed irripetibile.I personaggi sono tanti e variegati, ognuno con le proprie caratteristiche e specialit\u00e0, dalla famiglia delle due gemelle, al gruppetto di fate che veglia sui bambini del villaggio, il sindaco e la sua famiglia, gli amici e streghe e maghi tutti del villaggio e, infine, il grande e antico albero di quercia magico (Fairy Oak) che veglia sugli abitanti della citt\u00e0.La storia dell'autrice \u00e8 accattivante e avvincente, gi\u00e0 alle primissime pagine si \u00e8 trasportati nel mondo incantato narrato senza sforzo alcuno e, infatti, una volta entrati nella storia non si riesce pi\u00f9 abbandonarla se non quando si \u00e8 giunti alla parola fine.Menzione d'onore alle meravigliose illustrazioni che decorano un gi\u00e0 cos\u00ec ricco libro. Variano da vere e proprie illustrazioni a colori su pagine lucide a disegni vari che decorano le varie pagine, l'inizio di ogni capitolo e i fantastici risguardi a colori.Un racconto semplice, quanto lo pu\u00f2 essere un libro scritto per un giovane pubblico, caratterizzato da una visione del mondo magico ma soprattutto di un mondo ricco di colori, tutti diversi ma ognuno speciale a suo modo.In un racconto per bambini dove si fronteggiano il Bene e il Male l'autrice definisce il difficile tema della diversit\u00e0 e lo fa con semplicit\u00e0 e quel tocco di magia capace di incantare non solo i pi\u00f9 piccoli ma anche un pubblico adulto. In una fase dell'adolescenza in cui si cresce e si cambia e si inizia a definire la persona, ma soprattutto ci\u00f2 che ci differenzia dagli altri, l'autrice ha trovato il mondo di affrontare il tema spinoso della diversit\u00e0 e lo introduce con maestria portando il lettore a vedere s\u00ec il mondo con occhi diversi ma con stupore e meraviglia ma soprattutto accettazione.Una storia magica capace di incantare i pi\u00f9 piccini e non, da leggere ai propri figli, da rivisitare per chi \u00e8 nostalgico come la sottoscritta. Fairy Oak \u00e8 il libro dove la magia si dipinge di incanto, colori e felicit\u00e0, quella che i bambini servano nel cuore.5 Magiche Stelle", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3231578845", "review_id": "3231578845", "date": "Sep 20, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Paula", "user_url": "/user/show/66526966-paula", "text": "Despu\u00e9s de muchos, muchos a\u00f1os, he decidido leer esta trilog\u00eda de nuevo.

Es un personaje que me llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n desde la primera vez que apareci\u00f3 en escena y no puedo esperar a saber m\u00e1s de \u00e9l. Recomiendo 100% esta historia a todo amante de la fantas\u00eda y de las hadas, especialmente a los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os. A\u00fan recuerdo la paz y la tranquilidad que me invad\u00edan cuando le\u00eda estos libros de peque\u00f1a y aunque hayan pasado ya m\u00e1s de diez a\u00f1os, esa sensaci\u00f3n sigue en mi al volver a adentrarme en Fairy Oak.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "fairy-tales", "middle-grade"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2778595591", "review_id": "2778595591", "date": "Apr 26, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "www0rds", "user_url": "/user/show/82077368-www0rds", "text": "La nota corresponde a toda la saga aunque debo admitir que quiz\u00e1 la nota est\u00e9 subjetivada por el hecho de ser mi saga fav de la infancia.Este libro ha sido una relectura y la he disfrutado much\u00edsimo a pesar de haber pasado unos 10/11 a\u00f1os desde la \u00faltima vez.Hay de todo.

Ovviamente non mi sbagliavo, per\u00f2 odio vedere libri non letti che prendono polvere da anni nella mia libreria, quindi ho deciso di leggere il primo volume grazie ad un gdl trovato per caso su Instagram.Devo dire che \u00e8 stata una lettura molto carina, (non mi capitava da molto di leggere un libro immaginandolo come una serie animata anzich\u00e9 un film) per\u00f2 mi aspettavo un po' di pi\u00f9. Lo stile di scrittura \u00e8 scorrevolissimo, delicato e leggero, infatti si legge in poche ore.La trama per\u00f2 non mi \u00e8 sembrata costruita bene, ma pi\u00f9 una successione di eventi un po' frettolosa.Una cosa confusionaria \u00e8 stato proprio lo scorrere del tempo. La storia si svolge in 3/4 giorni (a parte i flashback iniziali sulla nascita di Vaniglia e Pervinca) ma secondo me i tempi sono troppo accelerati, nel giro di qualche riga si passa dall'ora di pranzo al tramonto senza che sia successo molto, mi \u00e8 sembrato una specie di errore.Comunque per essere un libro per bambini il sistema magico \u00e8 interessante, e la caratterizzazione dei personaggi principali: la fatina baby-sitter Fel\u00ec (narratrice in prima persona) e le gemelle Vaniglia e Pervinca \u00e8 fatta abbastanza bene, si percepisce che sono delle bambine di 9/10 anni con la loro tipica ingenuit\u00e0 e infantilit\u00e0, per\u00f2 non puoi fare a meno di affezionarti, soprattutto a Vaniglia.Le scene d'azione sono poche e frettolose, anche perch\u00e9 Fel\u00ec decide di non narrarle, anche se non capisco perch\u00e9, avrebbero dato pi\u00f9 dinamicit\u00e0 alla storia.Apprezzo che comunque si possano trovare insegnamenti di vita per i bambini: il legame tra sorelle, unico e speciale, anche se queste non possono essere pi\u00f9 diverse. L'amicizia, la bont\u00e0, le buone azioni, l'aiuto che si d\u00e0 in caso di difficolt\u00e0, la diversit\u00e0 e la famiglia sono i temi che uniscono questo racconto. Legger\u00f2 il secondo volume col gruppo di lettura di Instagram, e andr\u00f2 avanti con la storia, perch\u00e9 comunque voglio sapere cosa succede a V\u00ec, Bab\u00f9 e Fel\u00ec, ed \u00e8 una lettura leggera che consiglio anche nel periodo natalizio per le sue ambientazioni!", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "middlegrade"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1340463139", "review_id": "1340463139", "date": "Jul 20, 2015", "rating": 4, "user_name": "AlenGarou", "user_url": "/user/show/30632295-alengarou", "text": "Alla fine, dentro di noi rimaniamo sempre bambiniSono del parere che le fiabe non hanno et\u00e0.

Pero... tuve que bajarle una estrella\ud83d\ude14 LO SIENTO. Al tiro me explico. Solo una eso s\u00ed, porque me es imposible darle menos a un libro que me trae tantos bonitos recuerdos y al que le tengo tanto amor.Releer este libro despu\u00e9s de tanto tiempo (n\u00f3tese que ya lo he rele\u00eddo varias veces antes je) fue como hablar de nuevo con un viejo amigo, o volver a casa despu\u00e9s de pasar mucho tiempo fuera. Fue tan bonito volver a Fairy Oak y notar que no importa el tiempo que pase sigue siendo tan m\u00e1gico como siempre. De hecho, al ir pasando las p\u00e1ginas, viendo los bonitos dibujos que AMO, y al ver las p\u00e1ginas a color se me soltaron unas lagrimitas de nostalgia. Por cierto, un gran elemento de esta saga son las p\u00e1ginas a todo color que hay en cada uno de los libros. Son dos secciones como hacia la mitad del libro con unas 6 p\u00e1ginas quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s menos. ICONIC. Cuando chica me encantaban, no solo eran muy bonitas, me permit\u00edan adentarme m\u00e1s en el Valle de Verdellano. Nunca me aguantaba, apenas ten\u00eda el libro en mis manos me iba a ver esas p\u00e1ginas jaja. Me siguen encantando en realidad.El punto es que amo demasiado esta historia y a sus personajes, pero esta vez not\u00e9 como que faltaban explicaciones. Puede que sea mi impresi\u00f3n no m\u00e1s o parte de la simplicidad del libro, pero de repente me preguntaba como llegaron aqu\u00ed o cu\u00e1nto tiempo hab\u00eda pasado. No es realmente importante, aunque me dejaba pensando. Tambi\u00e9n puedo decir que se siente bastante cortito y m\u00e1s bien como la introducci\u00f3n de la historia m\u00e1s grande. Igual es uno de los plus de estos libros son s\u00faper r\u00e1pidos y f\u00e1ciles de leer. Y muy disfrutables cuando eres ni\u00f1o (se los dice la Caro de 7 a\u00f1os) y disfrutables despu\u00e9s, especialmente por el cari\u00f1o que se les guarda (se los dice la Caro de 17 a\u00f1os).Otra cosa que podr\u00eda comentar es que no recordaba lo vaga que era la descripci\u00f3n de la batalla final JJAJAJA la recordaba angustiante aunque creo que ten\u00eda que ver m\u00e1s con la persecusi\u00f3n de Vainilla. En fin. Igual siempre me gust\u00f3 esta dicotonom\u00eda de la luz y la oscuridad, como una no puede existir sin la otra, y el Enemigo, no como alguien en s\u00ed, sino como el mal que te consume. Con cada relectura le doy otro enfoque y la historia me llega distinto. A mi parecer, esa es una de las cosas m\u00e1s incre\u00edbles de esta saga.Finalmente decir que le baj\u00e9 una estrella porque apenas termin\u00e9 el primero empec\u00e9 el segundo y se nota distinto. Y mejor. No quiero dar muchos detalles pero me dio la impresi\u00f3n de que mejor\u00f3 la escritura y el, digamos, storytelling. (Adem\u00e1s que amo el Libro Antiguo) As\u00ed que guardo las 5 estrellas para el sgte libro.Sali\u00f3 m\u00e1s larga esta rese\u00f1a PERO es que amo mucho a Fairy Oak y a sus personajes (Shirley Poppy es superior) y me encanta volver a ellos siempre que pueda. ESPECIALMENTE PORQUE EL A\u00d1O PASADO SALI\u00d3 UN NUEVO LIBRO AAAAAAAAAAA \u00bfPUEDEN CREERLO? YO A\u00daN NO. LO TENGO EN MIS MANOS Y YA QUIERO EMPEZARLO.

Este livro \u00e9 o di\u00e1rio de uma fada baby-sister chamada felizeusereivolodirei, mas conhecida como Feli.  Feli \u00e9 enviada para o vale do verdeplano onde ser\u00e1 encarregada de tomar conta de duas beb\u00e9s que em breve iriam nascer, duas g\u00e9meas que com o passar dos anos ir\u00e3o mostrar que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o iguais quanto todos pensavam, estas g\u00e9meas s\u00e3o Baunilha e Pervinca. Baunilha e Pervinca nasceram com uma diferen\u00e7a de 12 horas uma da outro. Primeiro veio Pervinca \u00e0 meia-noite em ponto e depois Baunilha ao meio-dia em ponto. Mas elas n\u00e3o se diferenciam s\u00f3 pela dist\u00e2ncia de horas que as separam!

Mas para saberem mais ter\u00e3o de ler o livro, ah pois ..... achavam que vos ia contar tudo? Nem pensar ainda existe muito a revelar e os segredos mant\u00eam-se vivos at\u00e9 \u00e0 leitura desta fant\u00e1stica hist\u00f3ria contada por Feli.. Venham e descubram tudo. Adorei este livro, est\u00e1 lind\u00edssimo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 em aspecto mas tamb\u00e9m na escrita. A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 muito simples de entender e muito f\u00e1cil para as crian\u00e7as gostarem , e os adultos tamb\u00e9m. A componente m\u00e1gica que o livro tem, deixa qualquer um estarrecido. Durante a leitura vamos conhecendo muitas personagens e as suas caracter\u00edsticas. Podemos dizer que Elisabetta Gnone adora caracterizar e sabe faz\u00ea-lo muito bem e muito detalhadamente. Mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 de magia que o livro fala, ah pois n\u00e3o. Com esta hist\u00f3ria aprendemos algumas li\u00e7\u00f5es, mas existe uma que se destaca desde o princ\u00edpio e que \u00e9 muito importante: O amor entre a fam\u00edlia, em especial entre irm\u00e3os. Com este livro ficamos a conhecer duas g\u00e9meas que a n\u00edvel de feitios s\u00e3o muitos diferentes, mas que apesar de todas as advert\u00eancias e obst\u00e1culos por que t\u00eam que passar, o que elas sentem uma pela outro \u00e9 mais forte e nada poder\u00e1 destruir isso, muito menos coisas parvinhas (como diria Baunilha). Relativamente \u00e0s personagens gostei muito da Pervinca, apesar de ter algumas atitudes incorretas, mas a verdade \u00e9 que adorei Baunilha e identifico-me muito com a personagem dela, n\u00e3o em tudo mas em certas coisas. Baunilha \u00e9 uma menina muito doce, que adora o dia e o sol, detesta a noite e morre de medo, \u00e9 apaixonada pelos animais e acha-os a todos muito simp\u00e1ticos e amig\u00e1veis, Baunilha detesta a mentira e est\u00e1 constantemente contra a irm\u00e3 nisso. Por outro lado Pervinca \u00e9 muito dona de si mesma, adora a noite, \u00e9 muito forte mas ao mesmo tempo muito tristonha pois acha que ela tem sempre que esperar por tudo e a irm\u00e3 n\u00e3o, \u00e9 uma menina que \u00e0s vezes se esquece que n\u00e3o \u00e9 a \u00fanica no mundo, mas ao mesmo tempo \u00e9 muito amiga dos seus amigos, \u00e9 simp\u00e1tica e muito brincalhona, adora pregar partidas a todos. A personagem que menos gostei foi a da Scarlet, esta menina \u00e9 uma humana n\u00e3o-m\u00e1gica que detesta as g\u00e9meas, faz de tudo para as irritar, \u00e9 uma menina muito c\u00ednica, mentirosa, metida (adora meter-se na vida dos outros), acha-se a princesa do vale por o pai ser o presidente da c\u00e2mara e quer ser sempre convidada para todas as festas, se souber que ir\u00e1 acontecer uma festa e ela n\u00e3o foi convidada \u00e9 capaz de roubar o convite a algu\u00e9m e aparecer na festa . Pata mim \u00e9 uma menina muito m\u00e1. No geral amei o livro e quero muito arranjar o pr\u00f3ximo volume, apesar de ser car, mas ainda hei-de compr\u00e1-lo. Por isso pessoal j\u00e1 sabem se ficaram curiosos por esta hist\u00f3ria toca a ler e a dar a vossa opini\u00e3o, acreditem que vai valer a pena. :D", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-in-2017"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2259938983", "review_id": "2259938983", "date": "Mar 02, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Seli Ombre Angeliche", "user_url": "/user/show/76292185-seli-ombre-angeliche", "text": "\"Da oltre mille anni, a mezzanotte precisa, nelle case di Fairy Oak avviene un fatto magico: minuscole fate luminose raccontano storie di bambini a streghe dagli occhi buoni, emozionate e attente.Insolito, vero?!Tutti sanno che fate e streghe non vanno d'accordo e che alle streghe i bambini non piacciono affatto. Ma siamo nella valle di Verdepiano, nel villaggio di Fairy Oak e qui le cose vanno sempre un po' diversamente...\"E' cos\u00ec che inizia la nostra avventura a Fairy Oak, con questo prologo assai magico e curioso.La protagonista di questa trilogia \u00e8 Fel\u00ec, una fatina baby-sitter assunta dalla famosa strega Tomelilla per crescere e curare le sue nipotine, le gemelle Vaniglia e Pervinca.Grazie al diario di Fel\u00ec ci troviamo catapultati nella valle di Verdepiano, dove un paesino vive tranquillo e armonioso: Fairy Oak. Ma anche a Fairy Oak, dove i Magici e i Nonmagici da sempre vivono sereni, la pace sta per essere spezzata, e le gemelle Periwinkle si troveranno ad affrontare qualcosa di potente e oscuro, che metter\u00e0 a repentaglio non solo loro e il villaggio, ma anche il loro legame.Aspettavo da molto di rileggere questa trilogia, perch\u00e9 come avrete immaginato la adoro. Amo tutto di questi libri.. i personaggi, la storia, l'ambientazione e la sensazione di tranquillit\u00e0 che mi lascia.Fairy Oak \u00e8 una trilogia pensata per i bambini dai 9 anni in su quindi, come sempre, vi avviso che dovete amare i fantasy per ragazzi per apprezzare questa saga. Se avete voglia di qualcosa di pi\u00f9 adulto sicuramente non fa al caso vostro.Lo stile dell'autrice \u00e8 semplice, ma anche delicato in quanto vediamo la storia raccontata dal punto di vista di una fata, e le descrizioni del villaggio sono fantastiche.La trama ha qualcosa che mi affascina e che non annoia mai, tutto succede ad un ritmo incalzante facendo s\u00ec che il lettore resti incollato alle pagine.Ho amato molto il personaggio cattivo della storia perch\u00e9 per una volta non abbiamo a che fare con un'antagonista in carne e ossa, ma con qualcosa di malvagio e crudele che resta per\u00f2 impalpabile.. qualcosa di terrificante che aleggia su Fairy Oak e che si insinua nel villaggio e nei cuori degli abitanti, qualcosa che sembra impossibile combattere.Gli altri personaggi non sono da meno: Vaniglia e Pervinca sono streghe gemelle, ma completamente diverse tra loro e ben caratterizzate. Fel\u00ec riesce a trasmettere la delicatezza che nelle fiabe rende cos\u00ec uniche le fate, e insieme a loro conosciamo Grisam, Flox e Shirley, amici delle gemelle che avranno un ruolo fondamentale nella trilogia, proprio perch\u00e9 Fairy Oak si basa sul potere dell'amicizia, sulla forza che questo sentimento ha, e su come sia importante avere qualcuno che ci sorregga al momento giusto.Personalmente amo le piccole lezioni di vita che \u00e8 in grado di trasmettere questo libro, che \u00e8 importantissimo anche per i pi\u00f9 piccoli: la diversit\u00e0, la solitudine, l'amicizia e la complicit\u00e0. E questa cosa la dimostra soprattutto un personaggio: Shirley Poppy, una ragazzina che far\u00e0 amicizia con le gemelle, e che fin da subito svela qualcosa di molto speciale..In ultimo, ma non meno importante: il villaggio. Credo che se potessi andrei ad abitarci anche io. Fairy Oak \u00e8 un paesino di pietra e sentieri, non lontano dal mare. E' un villaggio che sa di Spumoni alla fragola, vento di mare, torta di more e matite temperate.. un luogo magico, dove la magia crea e distrugge, e dove la forza che unisce gli abitanti spesso risulta una salvezza.

Desde entonces he rele\u00eddo muchas veces la historia, en ocasiones buscando los recuerdos de mi infancia y, en otras, el amparo del Valle del Verdellano. Sea cual sea finalidad de mis relecturas siempre he disfrutado mucho de esta historia por su sencillez, la calidez que emanan los personajes y, sin duda, por la humildad con la que fue escrita por Elisabetta Gnone. A principios de siglo (XXI) recuerdo que hab\u00eda bastantes historias sobre brujas y hadas en el mercado o, al menos, esa era mi percepci\u00f3n (porque es que yo pasaba el d\u00eda dibujando hadas y chicas \u201cm\u00e1gicas\u201d). No creo que Elisabetta Gnone innove de ninguna manera en el tema brujas o la magia, pero sabe coger todos los fundamentos esenciales y escribir algo que acelera el coraz\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes lectores. Elisabetta Gnone es una autora ligada a nuestra generaci\u00f3n, que nos ha impulsado a descubrir historias m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de Fairy Oak.En el primer volumen de Fairy Oak nos introduce los primeros a\u00f1os de vida dos j\u00f3venes brujas casi gemelas. Pero a pesar de sus poderes, las hermanas Periwinkle son unas ni\u00f1as totalmente normales: van a la escuela con los dem\u00e1s ni\u00f1os, se enamoran, hacen los deberes, juegan con sus amigos, enferman, ect. Nadie excluye a nadie por tener poderes o carecer de estos, porque en Fairy Oak M\u00e1gicos y Sinmagia viven en perfecta armon\u00eda. Pero con la llegada del solsticio de verano un enemigo conocido amenaza de nuevo la armon\u00eda y estabilidad de los ciudadanos de Fairy Oak, y todos deber\u00e1n unirse para combatir al Terrible 21. Historia lineal, amena y que se lee en un rato (a mi edad y mi larga experiencia literaria, claro). Evoca tiempos pasados, y no solo porque la narraci\u00f3n va ligada a nuestra infancia. Por momentos la historia parece transportarnos a la Cornualles de principios de siglo XX en algunos aspectos, localizaci\u00f3n en la que estoy segura que la autora se inspir\u00f3 para crear el Valle de Verdellano. Mis personajes favoritos siempre que releo la historia terminan siendo Bab\u00fa y Shirley Poppy, tal vez porque la dulzura y candidez de una de las hermanas me recuerda a la m\u00eda, y la asilvestrada Poppy me recuerda a m\u00ed misma a esas edades, cuando la naturaleza es nuestra mejor amiga y hermana.

Oggi vi parlo del primo libro della trilogia di Fairy Oak: il segreto delle gemelle scritto da Elisabetta Gnone e pubblicato da Salani, una saga letteraria ormai acclamata in tutto il mondo. Purtroppo ho avuto solo ora l\u2019occasione di immergermi in questa storia e ammetto di non saperne il vero motivo. Fin da quando ero piccola mi ha sempre catturata ma non le ho mai dato una possibilit\u00e0. Forse \u00e8 meglio cos\u00ec, perch\u00e9 solo leggendo il libro ora ho saputo cogliere molti aspetti di questo racconto che sicuramente passano invisibili agli occhi dei pi\u00f9 piccoli. Probabilmente leggere un libro per bambini con la consapevolezza di un adulto permette a quest\u2019 ultimo di scoprire la vera essenza del racconto.  Ma di cosa parla Fairy Oak?Durante la lettura delle pagine del libro, grazie alla voce narrante Fel\u00ec, una delle tante fatine che avremo occasione di conoscere nel corso della vicenda, facciamo conoscenza del villaggio di Fairy Oak dove vivono insieme umani, maghi e streghe in perfetta armonia. Conosciamo poi le gemelle Pervinca e Vaniglia Periwinkle, cui Fel\u00ec fa da balia, due bambine simili e diverse allo stesso tempo, con poteri completamente opposti, che si devono preparare a combattere il Terribile 21, un antico nemico del villaggio che cercher\u00e0 di separare le due sorelle. La storia mi ha catturata fino alle prime pagine; l\u2019ho trovata molto piacevole e scorrevole, perfetta per esser gustata insieme ad una tazza di the fumante al cioccolato e arancia accompagnata da qualche dolcetto. Ho adorato tutti i personaggi, soprattutto Pervinca e Grisam: non vedo l\u2019ora di leggere di loro nei prossimi libri! Seppur si tratti di un libro per piccoli, i triangoli amorosi stanno bene ovunque. La storia sa trasmettere ed insegnare molti temi tra cui: l\u2019amicizia, il coraggio, la tenacia, la forza ma anche la gelosia, la parit\u00e0 dei sessi e l\u2019inadeguatezza. Tutti messaggi che meritano di essere analizzati con pi\u00f9 accuratezza: il pi\u00f9 importante, secondo il mio punto di vista, \u00e8 accettare gli altri per quel che sono, per i loro pregi e difetti, per le loro paure e per i loro sogni. Esempio ne \u00e8 la fata cicciottella, perdonatemi se non ne riporto il nome perch\u00e9 momentaneamente non mi sovviene, che ha paura di volare e, pur disponendo anche lei di ali, preferisce camminare. Ma ci\u00f2 non \u00e8 oggetto di derisione.Come sempre un libro, sebbene indirizzato ad un pubblico infantile, pu\u00f2 entrare anche nei cuori dei pi\u00f9 grandi, e cos\u00ec \u00e8 stato per me. A volte una storia semplice, ricca di illustrazioni e ben strutturata \u00e8 quello che ci occorre. \u00c8 sempre bello tornare a rivivere un po\u2019 di spensieratezza.

Avevo pure qualche dubbio ma ero piccola e sui dubbi non ci riflettevo pi\u00f9 di tanto. L\u2019ho riletto ieri in occasione della reading rush e molte cose non vanno. Continuo ancora ad apprezzare questa saga perch\u00e8 \u00e8 stata parte della mia infanzia ma ci sono cose di cui parlare.Innanzitutto chiediamoci: come avviene la trasmissione dei poteri da zii a nipoti?Cio\u00e8 si dice che i magici rivelano i loro poteri verso i dieci anni, e che questi poteri sono trasmessi dagli zii. Per\u00f2 si dice pure che quando Scarlet Violet Pimpernel scomparve si port\u00f2 con s\u00e9 gli ultimi poteri della famiglia Pimpernel. Tuttavia se i magici rivelano i poteri verso i dieci anni comunque i poteri vengono trasmessi alla nascita e dunque non capisco come la scomparsa centri con la perdita dei poteri. Forse non vi era ancora alcun nipote? Anche posto ci\u00f2 comunque una volta nato avrebbe dovuto ereditare i poteri della zia (se sono miope perch\u00e9 mi \u00e8 stato trasmesso da un certo membro della mia famiglia, non \u00e8 che scomparendo questo la miopia non mi venga trasmessa). O forse la trasmissione avviene nei primi anni di vita dei bambini ed \u00e8 necessario che zie/zii siano presenti nella vita dei nipoti? Queste piccole cose (secondo me importanti per la comprensione e la costruzione del mondo magico) non vengono spiegate adeguatamente.E se uno ha pi\u00f9 zii? E tra questi sta anche un non magico come funziona la cosa?E se Tomelilla avesse avuto figli? Insomma leggendolo ora sorgono una serie di domande che anche da piccola mi ponevo ma non avevo l\u2019esperienza di lettura di oggi per analizzarle. Inoltre mi sembra una trovata un po\u2019 troppo comoda a livello di trama far s\u00ec che tutti gli zii siano senza marito/moglie/figli.Parliamo poi delle legge magiche: non ho capito perch\u00e9 la legge sulla trasmissione dei poteri. Mentre sull\u2019Infinito potere si spiega cosa comporterebbe il non rispettare la regola di un Infinito potere per volta, per la legge sulla trasmissione dei poteri non sembra esserci una reale ragione, non ci spiegano cosa comporterebbe infrangere questa legge (i poteri devono essere trasmessi da zii a nipoti). Anche perch\u00e9 i maghi non hanno potere sulla trasmissione, non sono loro a decidere, dunque perch\u00e9 fare una legge su qualcosa che non si pu\u00f2 controllare ?E ancora che senso ha il Terribile 21? Ok si \u00e8 cattivo perch\u00e9 odia ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 bello e bla bla bla ma puoi provare a crearmi un personaggio pi\u00f9 caratterizzato, pi\u00f9 sensato. Non \u00e8 brutto per carit\u00e0 ma dopo anni in cui ho letto libri per ragazzi con antagonisti sensati mi sembra un personaggio inutile, cattivo per sole esigenze di trama.E infine la goccia che ha fatto traboccare il vaso, una cosa di cui nessuno parla e qualcuno mi dica se me la sono immaginata io: sequenze temporali.Allora siamo al 21 giugno, avviene il primo attacco,ok, finisce l\u2019attacco e Tomelilla spiega alle ragazze un po\u2019 di cose poi tutti a dormire tranne Tomelilla che va alla riunione dei saggi e Fel\u00ec che la attende. Perfetto. Il giorno dopo \u00e8 il 22 giugno, fanno la loro lezione di magia, Vaniglia si rattrista perch\u00e9 Grisam mostra interesse per Pervinca, tornano a casa la sera e Tomelilla le porta in giardino per istruirle sul comportamento delle lucciole. Pervinca vola per la prima volta, tutto molto bello, a nanna. Il giorno dopo \u00e8 domenica, le ragazze sentono i grandi discutere della ronda, Pervjnca scappa per avvertire Grisam, Vaniglia la segue e la rimprovera (cito testualmente): \u201cOggi vi ho visto, appiccicati a ridere\u201d ....WTF??? Ma \u00e8 stato il giorno prima!! Vabb\u00e8 mi dico, mi sono confusa io. Andiamo avanti, Vaniglia si incazza e se ne va sotto Quercia ed ecco che di nuovo (riferendosi all\u2019attacco del 21 sera): \u201cho saputo quello che \u00e8 successo a casa vostra ieri sera\u201d e dico io passi una volta ma ce la facciamo a rispettare la linea temporale, si? A parte che questa giornata \u00e8 confusa, si passa in un niente dall\u2019ora di colazione all\u2019ora di pranzo, poi all\u2019improvviso si fanno le sette di sera....Insomma passi il mondo magico magari abbozzato, passi il triangolo amoroso che pure ci ha stancato, per\u00f2 almeno alla costruzione temporale potevamo prestare attenzione. Ripeto non \u00e8 un brutto libro semplicemente \u00e8 un libro abbozzato e continuer\u00f2 a provare affetto perch\u00e9 l\u2019autrice mi ha cresciuta, per\u00f2 ecco non usciamocene con \u201c\u00e8 un libro per bambini, devi farti trasportare dalla magia e dall\u2019avventura\u201d perch\u00e9 no.....Senza scomodare Tolkien leggete Lemony Snicket, leggete \u201cQueste oscure materie\u201d ( che pure ha qualche difetto ma ti fa ragionare come poche cose al mondo e i bambini hanno bisogno di ragionare), ma leggete anche le WITCH (almeno la prima saga) ideate dalla stessa autrice di Fairy Oak. Si pu\u00f2 scrivere qualcosa che ti faccia traportare in mondi magici e avventurosi e che sia anche coerente e ben costruito. Che poi ripeto gi\u00e0 da bambina mi rendevo conto che il primo libro era un po' meh mentre gli altri invece parevano pi\u00f9 ragionati.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3636650435", "review_id": "3636650435", "date": "Nov 09, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Diana", "user_url": "/user/show/121223663-diana", "text": "It's 5 stars for me just because it's the very first fantasy I've ever read and I LOVED it, I'm planning to read it again soon <3", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3088650841", "review_id": "3088650841", "date": "Dec 17, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ester", "user_url": "/user/show/106669141-ester", "text": "Wow", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/647397897", "review_id": "647397897", "date": "Nov 08, 2020", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Fany", "user_url": "/user/show/21524024-fany", "text": "Muy bonito, me trajo buenos recuerdos de tiempos m\u00e1s sencillos.

Je dis superbe, il l'est, m\u00eame si je ne lui ai mis que 2 \u00e9toiles. Mais que je vous explique pourquoi, il y a quelques raisons qui viennent \u00e9tayer ma d\u00e9ception partielle vis \u00e0 vis de cette histoire qui partait plut\u00f4t bien de prime abord, un premier tome de trilogie fantasy jeunesse, a priori, tout ce qu'il faut pour me plaire. Oui. MAIS... Je ne saurais dire si c'est la traduction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2cl\u00e9e ou le texte original qui laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer mais j'ai trouv\u00e9 le style r\u00e9p\u00e9titif, assez bancal dans certaines formulations et tr\u00e8s simpliste avec des descriptions bas\u00e9es sur de simples \u00e9num\u00e9rations peu parlantes. A vouloir s'adresser \u00e0 un tr\u00e8s jeune public, le rendu est tr\u00e8s fade et manque cruellement de teneur.  Ajoutez \u00e0 cela que l'action et l'intrigue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale tr\u00e8s simple sont assez brouillonnes et s'emm\u00ealent un peu les pinceaux. On a l'impression de lire un premier jet par moments, d'autant que le texte est emmaill\u00e9 de quelques coquilles dactylographiques assez nombreuses pour \u00eatre soulign\u00e9es. Il y a pas mal de longueurs et de r\u00e9p\u00e9titions (\"la \"chose\" la plus \"adjectif que j'avais jamais connue : formulation maintes et maintes fois r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e par exemple), notamment des voyeeeeeelles et MAJUSCULES dans les dialogues \"cri\u00e9s\", n'est-ce pas un brin p\u00e9nible ??? Horripil\u00e9e par les noms \u00e0 rallonges des f\u00e9es (le principe du nom complet pour un contr\u00f4le \u00e9tait bien trouv\u00e9 mais des noms qui tiennent sur deux lignes de texte je dis c'est un brin too much) avec des adjectifs n\u00e9ologiques horripilurticants toutes les 3 pages. Un m\u00e9chant super m\u00e9chant mais qu'on ne voit pas, une bataille qui fait rage pendant... euh... 3 pages et des personnages \u00e0 peine survol\u00e9s (pour des f\u00e9es c'est pas mal remarquez ^^). Bref, le fond c'est vraiment pas la forme ! La forme, parlons-en, c'est sans conteste, ce qui sauve ce livre ! J'adore cet objet livre. La couverture est sublime, les gravures diss\u00e9min\u00e9es dedans \u00e0 la fin des chapitres sont tr\u00e8s belles, pleines de po\u00e9sie et de magie, d\u00e9licates et joyeuses. Les deux livrets d'illustrations papier glac\u00e9 en couleur sont sublimes et apportent vraiment ce qui manque au texte, des personnages d\u00e9taill\u00e9s. Sur l'histoire, j'appr\u00e9cie cet humour mignonnet, le fait que le r\u00e9cit soit racont\u00e9 par la f\u00e9e-nounou, protagoniste assez secondaire face aux h\u00e9ro\u00efnes du r\u00e9cit. J'ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant l'antagonisme entre les Magiques de la Lumi\u00e8re et ceux de l'Obscurit\u00e9 dans un travail non associ\u00e9 aux notions de Bien et de Mal comme c'est souvent le cas, m\u00eame si j'aurais appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 plus de d\u00e9veloppement de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9-l\u00e0. En somme, un premier tome fastidieux et un peu ennuyeux, tr\u00e8s beau graphiquement mais qui ne m'a pas plus convaincue que \u00e7a et ne m'a pas donn\u00e9 envie d'aller lire la suite. Cependant, je ne suis pas le public cible pour ce genre de litt\u00e9rature, que je situerai chez des petites filles de 8-9 ans, qui aime regarder la s\u00e9rie anim\u00e9e cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'auteur.

In questa magica cittadina nascono due gemelle Vaniglia e Pervinica due bambine nate dodici ore di distanza l\u2019una dall\u2019altra e con poteri magici totalmente differenti. Il 21 ottobre un forte temporale si abbatte su Fairy Oak e sar\u00e0 il presagio che un nuovo nemico sta arrivando in citt\u00e0 per distruggere gli equilibri della cittadina.Ho letto questo primo volume della trilogia di Fairy Oak grazie a un Gruppo di lettura (GDL) organizzato da delle bookblogger e bookstagrammer su Instagram. Devo ringraziarle perch\u00e9 senza di loro non mi sarei tuffato nel mondo magico di Fairy Oak. Partiamo ora con la recensione vera e propria! Pensavo mi potesse piacere molto di pi\u00f9 e invece \u00e8 stata una semi delusione. Ho trovato infatti questo primo volume a volte molto lento altre volte invece troppo affrettato. Mi spiego meglio per evitare incomprensioni. Ho trovato questo primo volume in alcuni punti lento perch\u00e8 mi sembrava che la lettura non terminasse mai. Dall\u2019altra parte ho trovato questo libro affrettato perch\u00e9 in alcuni punti mi sembrava come se l\u2019autrice avesse premuto il tasto dell\u2019acceleratore. Questa ultima mia affermazione \u00e8 dovuta al fatto che in alcuni punti avrei preferito un approfondimento magari su il mondo magico, ma anche sulla storia pregressa della cittadina di Fairy Oak. Immagino per\u00f2 che negli altri due libri venga approfondito maggiormente anche tutto il passato di Fairy Oak.Un altro fattore che mi ha fatto gradire meno questo titolo \u00e8 il fatto che ho trovato la storia narrata relegata troppo al target di riferimento. Il libro infatti trasuda da tutti i suoi pori il suo essere prettamente un libro per bambini. Ho trovato la lettura un po\u2019 banalotta e confinata nei suoi limiti di libro per bambini. Non nego che ci siano delle morali davvero importanti come: il battersi per ci\u00f2 che si vuole raggiungere e per i propri amici, ma anche quello del rispetto della natura e della sua bellezza. Ma, a mio parere, il libro non ha il \u201cpotere\u201d di andare oltre al target di riferimento quindi a un lettore come me o ad un adolescente potrebbe risultare abbastanza noioso.In conclusione non voglio sconsigliarvi la lettura di questo romanzo perch\u00e9 alla fine \u00e8 una buona lettura che vi pu\u00f2 intrattenere magari sotto una coperta e con una buona cioccolata calda. Inoltre se siete amanti del fantasy potreste trovare questo titolo interessante e appassionarvi al mondo fantastico creato dall\u2019autrice. Vi consiglio di leggere questo titolo in autunno perch\u00e9 vi calerete meglio nella storia. Concludo questa recensione dicendo che probabilmente aver letto questo libro in digitale ha condizionato il piacere della lettura. Infatti penso che se avessi letto questo primo volume della trilogia di Fairy Oak in cartaceo avrei gradito maggiormente la lettura perch\u00e9 lo sfogliare le pagine,l\u2019annusare le pagine e toccare il volume penso sia un fattore in pi\u00f9 per apprezzare la lettura", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["letteratura-italiana", "gruppi-di-lettura"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4297709570", "review_id": "4297709570", "date": "Oct 20, 2021", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Selene", "user_url": "/user/show/125969565-selene", "text": "S\u00f3lo por todo lo que he sentido volviendo a este pueblo tan m\u00e1gico e incre\u00edble son m\u00e1s que merecidas las 5\u2b50.

He encontrado mucha gente fan de esta historia sin saber que existen m\u00e1s libros adem\u00e1s de los iniciales, as\u00ed que quer\u00eda destacarlo. Dicho esto y aviso: NO hay spoilers, Fairy Oak es una saga de magia, brujas y brujos, amor por la naturaleza y amor por las personas, con unas ilustraciones FANTABULOSAS, que son la gran base para adentrarse de lleno y relatada por el hada ni\u00f1era Fel\u00ed llamada por la gran bruja Tomelilla, con la \u00fanica misi\u00f3n de ser la luz que ilumine el camino de dos gemelas reci\u00e9n nacidas destinadas a ser brujas. Una historia que me acompa\u00f1\u00f3 durante gran parte de mi infancia, que recuerdo como varios cap\u00edtulos de mi vida maravillosos, ya que he hecho numerosas relecturas. Los tres libros iniciales son los que componen la historia principal, y hablan del misterio que rodea al pueblo de Verdellano, las gemelas, y el Enemigo. Elisabetta ha creado un mundo tan fantasioso, que es imposible no sumergirse en \u00e9l nada m\u00e1s comenzar. Leer el d\u00eda a d\u00eda de este pueblecito, el diario del hadita ni\u00f1era Fel\u00ed es rodearse de un ambiente de paz, alegr\u00eda, callejuelas empedradas, comercios locales, \u00e1rboles legendarios, vecinos amables, risas y sonrisas, much\u00edsimas, y sobre todo, cari\u00f1o. Hay mucho amor en esta historia. Es demasiado f\u00e1cil sentirte como en casa, y eso es lo que la hace tan especial. Sin embargo, la saga que vino despu\u00e9s de la principal, ``Los Cuatro Misterios\u00b4\u00b4 de la banda de amigos, el enganche en cuanto a los hechos que suceden bajan un poco de nivel, llegando a ser en ocasiones algo pesados. con p\u00e1ginas que me atrever\u00eda a decir llegan a sobrar.

Ma mi ero ripromessa di leggere questo libro coi miei figli un giorno. E infatti la prima volta che mi accinsi a leggerlo fu qualche mese fa, convinta che mia figlia potesse apprezzarlo, ma ahim\u00e8 non \u00e8 andata come speravo. Ma ci riprover\u00f2 sicuramente un giorno, o chiss\u00e0, magari la trover\u00f2 intenta a leggerselo da sola nella sua stanza.Comunque leggendo un capitolo a sera in sua compagnia, ammetto che non ero riuscita a coglierne alcun fascino, invece ora che sono riuscita a leggerlo per conto mio proseguendo capitolo dopo capitolo senza sosta, ne ho finalmente compreso la trama, il senso di alcune scene e soprattutto ne ho apprezzato il contenuto per quanto mi era possibile.Dire per\u00f2 che sia un capolavoro, no, non posso esserne d\u2019accordo, e conoscendo gi\u00e0 la Gnone grazie a Witch, mi aspettavo qualcosa di pi\u00f9. Ma essendo una saga, ad ora, aggiornata a 9 libri, penso che possa comunque migliorare molto, sia nell\u2019esporla che nella scrittura stessa, e soprattutto nella storia che tratter\u00e0.Sicuramente i bambini, il pubblico a cui \u00e8 rivolto questo libro, non si possono accorgere di alcuni dettagli o difetti di stile, struttura o di trama. Ma un adulto s\u00ec. E per quanto accetto che sia una semplice narrativa per ragazzi, non posso non sottolineare dei difetti che ho trovato particolarmente fastidiosi.Primo fra tutti: la fine di ogni capitolo. Non \u00e8 mai davvero un finale. Spesso e volentieri (dico volentieri perch\u00e9 mi rendevo conto che era anche voluto) lasciava il discorso a met\u00e0 completandolo nel capitolo successivo, come se quel giorno avesse dovuto smettere di scrivere per un impegno, e si fosse messa a riprendere l\u2019argomento cominciando una nuova pagina e quindi un nuovo capitolo. Trovandomi quindi a domandarmi se mai la Gnone abbia fatto dei corsi di scrittura per capire come impostare gli argomenti. A volte era snervante terminare il capitolo, perch\u00e9 magari dovevo sedermi a tavola, senza avere concluso davvero il discorso e sapendo che me lo avrebbe riproposto successivamente nel prossimo capitolo, con la speranza di tenermi a mente tutto, onde evitare di dovermi rileggere gli ultimi paragrafi per non perdere niente per strada.Secondo problema \u00e8 stato mostrare tanta trama dal punto di vista di Fel\u00ec, la fata babysitter delle due gemelle. Certo, inizialmente questa sembra una bellissima idea, innovativa e diversa dalla solita routine che si \u00e8 abituati a leggere, ma quando Fel\u00ec veniva ripetutamente rinchiusa nel suo barattolo (e mi \u00e8 apparsa una scelta stessa dell\u2019autrice per non mostrarci l\u2019evento in questione), perdendosi molto della vita di queste due ragazze, ci si ritrovava orfani di una parte della trama. Perch\u00e9 per quanto spostasse l\u2019obbiettivo su altri personaggi, tra cui a volte anche le gemelle (raro, ma capitava), mancava sempre comunque un pezzo per chiudere completamente quel cerchio. Ad esempio io mi sono infastidita a non sapere cosa si sono detti Grisam e Pervinca quando lui le ha donato l\u2019anellino (anche perch\u00e9 mi ero accorta che lui appariva interessato a Vi, ma non del tutto indifferente a Bab\u00f9, quindi non avevo dato per scontato che a lui piacesse solo una delle gemelle), o mi sarebbe piaciuto leggere di un progressivo aumento dei sentimenti di Pervinca per lui, (convinta io che lei proprio non se lo filava di striscio sto poveretto, figuratevi quando ho letto che lei indossava l\u2019anellino), peggio ancora quando Pervinca e Vaniglia hanno fatto pace e si sono chiarite riguardo ai sentimenti che entrambe provano a quanto pare nei confronti di Grisam. Credo che ogni lettore, adulto o bambino, volesse conoscere questo eclatante \u201cSegreto delle Gemelle\u201d, di cui persino il titolo ne menziona.Ce ne sono anche altre sottotrame abortite o volutamente messe da parte, ma si possono anche accantonare per un istante, tuttavia quella di cui ora vi parlo non doveva passare in sordina:Quel che manca davvero \u00e8 tutta la battaglia presente negli ultimi capitoli. Capisco il voler tenere nascosto gli eventi del precedente terribile 21, ma perch\u00e9 dirci cos\u00ec poco di questa battaglia? Fel\u00ec ci dice che lo sapremo dai libri di testo della scuola dove tutti gli studenti studieranno, ma noi non siamo abitanti di Fairy Oak, per cui dove andiamo a trovare tutta questa parte di storia? E niente, mettetevela via perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec siamo stati liquidati, salvo che non ne torneranno a parlare in uno dei prossimi libri, ma dal momento che era questo a contenere gli eventi, per me \u00e8 assurdo che io debba aspettare il prossimo volume per conoscerli. Mi \u00e8 apparso come un \u201cnon so come si scrivono le battaglie per cui salto di pari passo questo pezzo e vi racconto cosa succede dopo\u201d. No, cos\u00ec non va bene.Poi abbiamo Tomelilla che cavalca un vero drago bianco, s\u00ec vero, se si faceva attenzione all\u2019inizio del libro era stato accennato qualcosa riguardo questa sua attitudine, ma se non vuoi spiegarci gli esordi di questo particolare evento, almeno dicci come \u00e8 giunto a lei durante la battaglia. Puff, appare cos\u00ec dal nulla. Perch\u00e9? Me lo spieghi? Perch\u00e9 s\u00ec; anche qui nessuna logica. Prud, la fata babysitter di non mi ricordo pi\u00f9 chi, improvvisamente vola, dopo che era stato detto che lei aveva paura di volare e preferiva camminare. Per quale ragione quindi ha spiccato il suo primo volo? Perch\u00e9 s\u00ec. Mamma Dalia anche lei aveva poteri ed era una strega, perch\u00e9 ha smesso di usarli? Non li ha pi\u00f9? Non si sa. Potrei andare avanti per giorni con piccoli quesiti irrisolti da questo libro, ovviamente resta un libro per ragazzi, ma per come ero io da bambina, che volevo sempre sapere e conoscere tutto, mi sarei posta comunque queste stesse domande e ora che sono adulta, i miei figli si aspettano che io le conosca le risposte e invece non \u00e8 cos\u00ec.Questa cosa quindi non mi soddisfa. Bastava davvero un niente. Usa la fantasia, trova un motivo, stupido magari. Avevi la magia, potevi giustificarlo gi\u00e0 solo con questa. Tomelilla emette un richiamo magico, un fischio posizionando le dita in una certa maniera, o usa un particolare strumento (fischietto, ocarina, armonica) e il drago arriva, o lo fa apparire tramite un incantesimo di dislocazione, dimmi piuttosto una cosa banale, ma dimmela. Prud beve una pozione innovativa preparatale da X mago/strega, per infonderle pi\u00f9 coraggio e farle superare la paura.Shirley che appare all\u2019inizio in modo cos\u00ec casuale ma particolare, viene comunque presa tra le allieve di Tomelilla perch\u00e9 s\u00ec, poi pare diventare un personaggio molto importante verso la fine del libro, che sa fare tutte quelle magie, che vive da sola, che trascorre tutto il suo tempo con Barolo e il topolino (di cui ora mi sfugge il nome), Vaniglia passa ore in sua compagnia, tanto che il lettore pu\u00f2 arrivare a sospettare che dietro agli attacchi possa esserci questa innocua bambina\u2026 alla fine sparisce dalle scene, e perch\u00e9 quindi inserirmi in questo modo tutta la parte di casa sua e della passeggiata con Bab\u00f9? Non \u00e8 dato saperlo.Poi all\u2019inizio veniva detto che erano gli zii a trasmettere i loro saperi ai nipoti, ma Tomelilla crea questa sorta di scuola di magia posizionando banchi anche per i nipoti di altri stregoni\u2026 Eh? Qualquadra non cosa, mi pare a me. Ma viene spiegato il motivo? Ovviamente no.Poi parliamo di queste lezioni? Una, se vogliamo essere precisi, perch\u00e9 non c\u2019\u00e8 stato il tempo per metterne di pi\u00f9 in questo libro, dal momento che si \u00e8 perso un sacco di tempo nel raccontare delle gemelle che invitavano la gente per il compleanno di Tomelilla. Quali magie, pozioni, oggetti o incantesimi sono stati insegnati a queste bambine? Nulla, a parte dei regali del tutto o quasi inutili (utilizzati poco o niente dalle proprietarie) e la raccolta di erbe solo perch\u00e9 i piccoli maghi le sappiano riconoscere quando poi serviranno loro. Tutto qui? A sto punto quando nei primi giorni di scuola elementare quando le maestre danno la lista del materiale a noi genitori e prepariamo gli zaini ai nostri figli, questi sono gi\u00e0 pi\u00f9 avanti dei maghi di Fairy Oak perch\u00e9 almeno sanno che una matita serve a scrivere e colorare, mentre la gomma a cancellare.E le bacchette? Quale mistero occulto si cela dietro a colui che le ha messe nelle tasche di queste bambine? Chi avr\u00e0 mai potuto inventarsi un simile inganno? Quale incantesimo malvagio ci sar\u00e0 mai dietro? Niente di tutto ci\u00f2, era Cicero, loro padre che ha pensato di aggiungerle nella divisa perch\u00e9 a delle streghe non possono mancare delle bacchette. E il discorso non fa una piega, peccato che nel libro venga su una questione di stato da Fel\u00ec e Tomelilla, per poi sbugiardarsi nell\u2019ultimo capitolo. E a te lettore cadono le braccia di netto.Insomma, sia chiaro, non voglio dire che sia un brutto libro, ma se con le dovute precauzioni si faceva un po\u2019 di ordine e si davano delle spiegazioni meno lasciate al caso, avrebbe potuto essere un piccolo capolavoro degno del nome della Gnone.Voto quindi 6; 3 stelle.

Questa piccola e allegra fatina ci accompagner\u00e0 per tutto il volume e ci parler\u00e0 della vita delle due protagoniste della storia:\u00a0Vaniglia\u00a0e\u00a0Pervinca.Nel villaggio di\u00a0Fairy Oak\u00a0infatti, i maghi e le streghe sono soliti affidare i loro figli a delle tate, ovvero alle fate. All'inizio della nostra storia, assistiamo alla nascita delle due gemelle, nate l'una a dodici ore di distanza dall'altra. Questo fattore, all'apparenza superficiale, sar\u00e0 invece di grande importanza per le due bambine. Solitamente difatti, le gemelle non possono ereditare i poteri magici di famiglia ma, in questo caso, assistiamo a un'eccezione davvero particolare. Scopriremo che\u00a0Vaniglia\u00a0e\u00a0Pervinca\u00a0non solo sono delle streghette, ma possiedono anche poteri differenti e diametralmente opposti.Nel magico villaggio di\u00a0Fairy Oak, tutto procede per il meglio. Le bambine crescono, fanno amicizia e si divertono, quando una sera fa il suo ritorno un temibile nemico: il\u00a0Terribile 21. Questa oscura presenza, lontana dal villaggio ormai da anni, \u00e8 tornata pi\u00f9 forte che mai ed \u00e8 pronta a rendere la vita degli abitanti di\u00a0Quercia Fatata\u00a0un vero incubo.La storia narrata all'interno di questo primo volume riesce subito a catturare il lettore. La scelta di far narrare la storia a un personaggio sicuramente importante come la fatina\u00a0Fel\u00ec, ma non centrale come potevano esserlo le gemelle, \u00e8 originale e intrigante. Spesso infatti non conosciamo le condizioni o la posizione di\u00a0Vaniglia\u00a0e\u00a0Pervinca\u00a0e, insieme a\u00a0Fel\u00ec, ci preoccupiamo per la loro sicurezza finch\u00e9 la fata non riesce a fornirci aggiornamenti.\u00a0Altro aspetto importante \u00e8 il fatto che\u00a0Elisabetta Gnone\u00a0sia riuscita a introdurre il lettore alla sua saga e al mondo da lei creato in maniera impeccabile. Descrivendo personaggi, luoghi e magia senza per\u00f2 annoiare mai il suo pubblico. Ad allietare ulteriormente la lettura, inoltre, troviamo un gran numero di disegni davvero belli e ispirati, frutto della mente e del talento di\u00a0Alessia Martusciello, Corinne Giampiglia, Roberta Tedeschi e Claudio Prati.La saga di\u00a0Fairy Oak\u00a0viene solitamente etichettata come lettura per bambini e ragazzi ma, per esperienza personale, posso assicurarvi che si tratta di una serie di libri che riuscir\u00e0 ad appassionare anche i pi\u00f9 grandi.Il mondo delineato dalla\u00a0Gnone\u00a0\u00e8 magico, in tutti i sensi. A partire dal linguaggio utilizzato dall'autrice, semplice ma mai scontato, quasi poetico, reso ancora pi\u00f9 incantevole da alcuni termini coniati appositamente per la sua storia, fino ai suoi personaggi e alla trama.\u00a0\"Fairy Oak - Il Segreto delle Gemelle\", come anche i suoi seguiti, \u00e8 impregnato di numerosi messaggi importanti, primo fra tutti il legame tra due sorelle. Il loro rapporto e il suo sviluppo sono infatti protagonisti della vicenda e mostrano al lettore quanto profondo e importante esso possa essere. Un altro tema essenziale da non sottovalutare \u00e8 il rispetto verso la natura. Il mondo di\u00a0Fairy Oak\u00a0\u00e8 infatti pervaso dal verde. Piante e animali vivono felicemente in simbiosi con i nostri protagonisti e, attraverso la sua storia, la\u00a0Gnone\u00a0ha cercato di sensibilizzare grandi e piccini sulla tutela e il rispetto verso l'ambiente che ci circonda.Alcune delle caratteristiche che ho maggiormente apprezzato del libro, proprio in riferimento alla natura, sono la scelta di utilizzare nomi di piante e fiori per i personaggi della storia e la descrizione delle calze delle streghe e dei maghi. Tali indumenti, infatti, presentano ricami particolari che rappresentano i fiori e le piante tipiche del giardino del possessore. In questo modo, gli animali che abitano i loro prati, non si sentiranno mai minacciati dalla loro presenza. Ovviamente, all'interno di\u00a0Fairy Oak, vengono affrontati tantissimi altri temi importanti, come per esempio l'amicizia, l'amore, il pregiudizio e la diversit\u00e0. Anche in un mondo magico come questo, infatti, c'\u00e8 chi non riesce ad accettarsi e chi si sente diverso dagli altri, pensando di essere inadeguato. Abbiamo un esempio di questo tema importante nei ranghi delle fate, dove la povera\u00a0Prud, a causa del suo fisico pi\u00f9 massiccio rispetto alle compagne, teme di non riuscire a volare.Passando ora a parlare dei personaggi, posso dire di essere rimasta incantata dalla loro caratterizzazione e descrizione. Ogni mago o strega \u00e8 contraddistinto da un carattere ben preciso, da una capigliatura particolare e dalla passione per qualcosa, possa questa essere la natura, gli animali o il giardinaggio. Nonostante si tratti solamente del primo capitolo della saga, abbiamo modo di conoscere davvero un gran numero di personaggi e questo aggiunge sicuramente qualcosa in pi\u00f9 alla narrazione.In conclusione, con \"Fairy Oak - Il Segreto delle Gemelle\",\u00a0Elisabetta Gnone\u00a0\u00e8 riuscita letteralmente a stregarmi. Il mondo da lei creato e i suoi abitanti sono davvero incantevoli e mi domando come io abbia potuto crescere senza leggere neanche una volta questa splendida saga. Sono comunque felice di averla recuperata all'et\u00e0 di ventisei anni. Penso infatti che, attraverso uno sguardo pi\u00f9 adulto, io abbia potuto apprezzare la storia e i suoi messaggi ancor di pi\u00f9.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1568946720", "review_id": "1568946720", "date": "Mar 04, 2016", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Carol", "user_url": "/user/show/53370604-carol", "text": " Me alegro de haber podido volver a disfrutar de este libro, que me apasion\u00f3 de peque\u00f1a, que me hizo so\u00f1ar con el pueblo de Fairy Oak y vivir fant\u00e1sticas aventuras junto a las gemelas, Vainilla y Pervinca, su grupito de amigos y su hada Sifeliztuserasdecirmeloquerr\u00e1s, m\u00e1s conocida como Fel\u00ed.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["estanter\u00eda", "read-in-2016", "fantasy"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1716684559", "review_id": "1716684559", "date": "Aug 02, 2016", "rating": 4, "user_name": "eme", "user_url": "/user/show/43371234-eme", "text": "4.5 Estos libros son tan bonitos y amenos de leer que cada vez que los leo me pongo de buen humor, es una gran experiencia y me alegro mucho de haber tenido la oportunidad de leerlos cuando era peque\u00f1a y de poder releerlos ahora.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2662344836", "review_id": "2662344836", "date": "Jan 07, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Nadia", "user_url": "/user/show/91715245-nadia", "text": "I love this story so much \u2764\ufe0f", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2841549498", "review_id": "2841549498", "date": "May 31, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Valentina Trento", "user_url": "/user/show/66350747-valentina-trento", "text": "Riletta pi\u00f9 volte la saga", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fantasy", "favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1523911697", "review_id": "1523911697", "date": "Jan 24, 2016", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Genevi\u00e8ve", "user_url": "/user/show/33953249-genevi-ve", "text": "15/20 L'histoire est agr\u00e9able \u00e0 lire mais sans plus.

As\u00ed nos encontramos con la primera ense\u00f1anza que nos deja el libro, ser amistosos y amigos de ayudar a los dem\u00e1s.Continuando con esta idea, se nos va indicando c\u00f3mo se es m\u00e1s feliz siendo solidarios y protectores con nuestro entorno, disfrutando adem\u00e1s de la belleza y beneficios que produce la Naturaleza. Aunque haya personas dispuestas a destruirla para enriquecerse pecuniariamente, y priven a los dem\u00e1s de su m\u00e9todo de vida, de ocio, etc.Entre otros temas, tambi\u00e9n transmite el valor de la amistad entre hermanos, reflejando la importancia de alegrarte por tu hermano o hermana cuando reciba un premio, o tenga una buena noticia, y de la disponibilidad absoluta de ayuda para cuando se encuentre en una situaci\u00f3n dif\u00edcil o comprometida. As\u00ed como lo vital que es contar con la familia cuando se tengan problemas para que entre todos puedan solucionarlo aportando su consejo y conocimientos.Adem\u00e1s aporta la valiosa ense\u00f1a del respeto hacia los mayores, sin criticar sus decisiones, aunque siempre con la explicaci\u00f3n precisa y permanente por parte de los adultos del porqu\u00e9 realizar, o dejar de hacer, una acci\u00f3n. As\u00ed como dar la libertad justa y necesaria a los ni\u00f1os para que aprendan a valerse por s\u00ed mismos, sin entorpecer su aprendizaje, pero asegurando su bienestar e integridad. Favoreciendo de este modo que sus relaciones con el entorno sean m\u00e1s fluidas y desarrollen plenamente su potencial en cualquier \u00e1mbito de la vida, am\u00e9n de su personalidad.Y hablando de personalidad, en la novela se aprecia lo semejantes que son f\u00edsicamente las gemelas, pero lo diferentes en cuanto hablamos de personalidad. Una es pura dulzura, mientras que la otra es rebeli\u00f3n y aventura, aunque la suma de las dos da la persona perfecta, por eso ambas se complementan en sus relaciones sociales, protegi\u00e9ndose y ayud\u00e1ndose una a la otra.Igualmente se resalta el valor de la sinceridad y la honestidad, que junto a la solidaridad hacen que todos, o una poblaci\u00f3n, puedan desarrollarse y crecer en armon\u00eda, paz y prosperidad. Afeando, adem\u00e1s, acciones como el cotilleo, la envidia y la mentira junto al ego\u00edsmo. Es decir pone de manifiesto la importancia del conjunto sobre la individualidad para que todos tengan una vida mejor.Para finalizar, solo me resta decir que cualquier ser, por insignificante que parezca, en la novela el hada que cuida de las ni\u00f1as puede ser un buen ejemplo, tiene un cometido sin el cual nada funcionar\u00eda correctamente. Como bien se resalta en la novela, donde las diminutas hadas procuran una ayuda excepcional e impagable. Terminando esta rese\u00f1a, apunto mi opini\u00f3n personal sobre este libro infantil \u2013 juvenil, cuya lectura ser\u00eda recomendable a partir de una edad de 8/10 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, que recomiendo a los adultos leer para reflexionar sobre algunos valores perdidos conforme se van cumpliendo a\u00f1os. E incito a que los ni\u00f1os lean porque les entretendr\u00e1, les har\u00e1 disfrutar y educar\u00e1 en valores primordiales para que se conviertan en una buena persona. Por ello digo que es 100% recomendable.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_id": "59721145-el-secreto-de-las-gemelas", "book_title": "El secreto de las gemelas", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4552765018", "review_id": "4552765018", "date": "Feb 15, 2022", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Huntressofbooks", "user_url": "/user/show/57494833-huntressofbooks", "text": "[3/5]Por fin he le\u00eddo este libro, ya era hora que me pusiera con esta saga aunque bueno...llego unos buenos a\u00f1os tarde Conozco estos libros desde hace unos a\u00f1os pero no ha sido hasta que he llegado a Madrid que he empezado a echarles el ojo. Esto se debe a que dos de mis amigas aman estos libros y, pr\u00e1cticamente, me exig\u00edan que le diera una oportunidad. Es por esto que al obtenerlo en la Masa Cr\u00edtica me puse muy pero que muy contenta. Este libro est\u00e1 catalogado como fantas\u00eda juvenil, dir\u00eda con un m\u00e1ximo de edad de 11 a\u00f1os, porque creo que un p\u00fablico m\u00e1s adulto ya no lo disfrutar\u00eda tanto. Digo esto ya que si me imagino con esa edad leyendo esto creo que ya no lo disfrutar\u00eda tanto. Es cierto que lo estoy leyendo con 26 a\u00f1os y es por esto que no he podido darle m\u00e1s nota, aunque tambi\u00e9n es porque hay ciertas cosas que no me han terminado de convencer. Es cierto que la edad juega un papel fundamental a la hora de disfrutar la historia, pero suelo disfrutar de este tipo de libros sin ning\u00fan tipo de problema, es por eso que creo que es una historia preciosa, con una trama muy interesante y unos personajes muy particulares pero que, a\u00fan as\u00ed hay cosas que no me han convencido. La trama, como he dicho anteriormente, me ha parecido muy interesante porque el hecho de que el mundo tenga un sistema de magia tan bien creado y con unas ideas tan creativas me ha parecido muy pero que muy buen punto de partida. Adem\u00e1s, la historia invita a ser le\u00edda con much\u00edsima rapidez gracias a la narraci\u00f3n de la hadita que nos acompa\u00f1a a lo largo de la historia. Su forma de narrar y de explicar las situaciones es el punto de inflexi\u00f3n entre una narraci\u00f3n meh y una narraci\u00f3n fluida y bonita. Creo que el fallo, por lo menos bajo mi punto de vista, es que durante la narraci\u00f3n se van mezclando los nombres o motes de las protagonistas. Creo que para un ni\u00f1o el hecho de que nunca sea capaz de leer dos veces seguidas el mismo nombre debe ser un lio, si a mi como adulta me liaba con los motes en cierto momento no me quiero imaginar un ni\u00f1o m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o. Si desde el principio se nos muestra a las hermanas con sus diminutivos o motes, entiendo que deber\u00eda seguir as\u00ed durante toda la trama y no que, en el mismo p\u00e1rrafo, hay dos nombres distintos. Dejando esto de lado, creo que este libro es una muy buena introducci\u00f3n al mundo que vamos a ir conociendo, al sistema de magia y a los personajes principales y secundarios que nos ir\u00e1n acompa\u00f1ando a lo largo de la serie.En lo que respecta a los personajes, en general, me han parecido personajes muy peculiares, \u00fanicos y cre\u00edbles. Es cierto que no he llegado a cogerle cari\u00f1o a ninguno, salvo a la hadita, pero, en l\u00edneas generales, creo que ha sido una historia cargada de buenos personajes y con unas presentaciones muy buenas. Lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado de este libro es su edici\u00f3n. Creo que desde la sobrecubierta, que es preciosa, hasta al libro en si como si fuera un diario antiguo me ha enamorado. Adem\u00e1s, los bocetos que vamos encontrando a lo largo de los cap\u00edtulos me han dejado sin habla de lo bonitos que eran y si a eso le sumamos las p\u00e1ginas a color en formato de \u00e1lbum para conocer a los personajes, pues bueno apaga y v\u00e1monos. En conclusi\u00f3n, es una historia dulce y muy bonita para los ni\u00f1os como para los adultos, si estos van sabiendo lo que se van a encontrar. Deseando seguir con el resto de entregas pronto.

Quiz\u00e1s al ser el inicio de una trilog\u00eda mis dudas se aclaran en los otros dos tomos, pero a la vez creo que, siendo el inicio, todos los puntos b\u00e1sicos del mundo m\u00e1gico deber\u00edan ser aclarados ahora para despu\u00e9s explotarlos en el resto de la historia. Hubieron escenas de acci\u00f3n y batalla que podr\u00edan haber sido narrados en tres hojas completas y pens\u00e9 \"Al fin, se viene la bomba y la rompe toda\", pero al final la lucha que hubo se resumi\u00f3 en \"Vinieron los dem\u00e1s magos a ayudar y vencimos.

La famiglia Periwinkle, specialmente la zia Tomelilla, attende impaziente che le sue nipotine mostrino di aver ereditato i poteri di famiglia.

There are some glorious similes here but the power they wield is diminished by the sheer number, sometimes three and four on a page (also mixed in with metaphors). And some of the lesser similes are clunkers and give the text a feeling of trying too hard. Same with some of the word choices.

Beauregard knew there was no honor among thieves. Boys in the game only respected you in direct proportion to how much they needed you divided by how much they feared you. There was no doubt they needed his skill.And if they weren't a little bit afraid of him then that was their mistake.do not underestimate beauregard montage. or s.a. cosby. this one's a winner. *********************this is an excerpt from the little author-letter slipped into the book and it's perfect. I believe in toxic masculinity and the harmful patriarchal hegemony that it engenders. But I also believe in tragic masculinity. A self-flagellating mindset that diminishes men by inches even as we believe it is protecting us. Tragic masculinity injures us on the inside and leaves behind scars that are felt, not seen. Blacktop Wasteland is about the hereditary disease that is poverty, but it's also about the violent inheritance that damaged men pass on to their sons. Not just physical violence but the emotional punishment that we inflict on ourselves.It's also got a badass cherry 1971 Plymouth Duster in it.

Nope, I cannot give anything less than five gazillion stars because from the first pages, breathtaking, action packed, truly dramatic Beauregard Montage\u2019s story enhances you. You feel the several harsh slaps of reality against cheek throughout your reading journey. Beauregard a.k.a. Bug loses the fight with his inner demons, hearing whispers to his father who introduced him to the criminal life when he was younger boy. He wanted to be a good husband, a good father who is capable to provide his own children\u2019s needs. He wants to keep the roof over their heads and conduct a successful business but he fails: he is behind the mortgage payment of his car shop and he gets a call from his mother\u2019s nursing home inform him they\u2019re so close to kick his mother out. It\u2019s simple and clear: He cannot make his ends meet. He needs to find ANOTHER SOURCE TO GET OUT OF HIS GROWING DEPTH PROBLEM ASAP!He hears the sound of screaming tires, smelling the dust of asphalt, shivering with adrenaline pumping. He is not Dominic Toretto! Nope, he\u2019s incarcerated Steve McQueen. The passion of racing is in his blood, soul. It helps him to stay alive. He cannot deny the dark side\u2019s calling: he enjoys the speed, adrenaline rush, facing the danger like a sea breeze brushing his cheeks. He is still a good man who is dealt a very bad hand. So he needs to cheat for winning this game. He has too at stake so one more driving job won\u2019t make things worse, right? But as you may imagine, things can get more complicated than he expected! I\u2019m not giving more spoilers. You just have to learn what\u2019s gonna happen next by yourself but I\u2019m so sure for one thing: as soon as you get this book into your hands, you will be captivated by the high skilled, mesmerizing writing and well-developed characters, getting lost in dark, intense, realistic crime world. It was more effective than watching an action packed, exciting thriller. There is no cliche, no pretense, no exaggeration.

Cosby has created some great characters here, starting with Bug. He\u2019s a decent man who's been handed a raw deal. You just want things to work out for him. His mother is a total piece of work and it\u2019s a testament to his decency that he doesn\u2019t just walk away from her. And my God, Bug\u2019s co-criminals are not going to win any awards for smarts or ethics. You just know that things aren\u2019t going to go well. The writing is fabulous.

You always kept a gun within reach, not buried under cement in your basement. Having a gun nearby was the only way you could pretend to relax.\u201dOnce the best getaway driver on the East Coast, Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage has put that life behind him. He\u2019s a husband, a father, an excellent mechanic. But lately the pressure has been mounting\u2014the kids need glasses, braces, everything, and business has slowed down\u2014and he doesn\u2019t know how to get his head above water.So when a guy with whom he\u2019s worked before shows up, recently out of prison and talking about a can\u2019t-miss scheme involving a jewelry store and a tremendous payoff, Bug can\u2019t resist the temptation to get back behind the wheel again, despite everyone\u2019s warnings to the contrary. What Bug doesn\u2019t really count on, however, is just how messy a web he\u2019s about to step in. At the same time he\u2019s trying to figure out what kind of life he really wants to lead, he\u2019s haunted by memories of his father, who also was a renowned wheelman, and who disappeared when Bug was younger. His father left him a classic car, and he can't help but conjure up memories of him each time he gets behind the wheel.In addition to some pulse-pounding chases and action scenes, this book explores the idea of whether a life of crime is somehow hard-wired in our genes, or if it\u2019s just a life some are backed into. S.A. Cosby is such a fantastic writer because he makes you root for Bug and his family despite the choices he made.

Beauregard 'Bug' Montage once used to be the go to wheelman, but he turned his back on that thrillingly addictive life of risk and crime, although he is not a man to take chances, just in case trouble comes he has guns in every room of his home. For some years, he has made a living as a car mechanic to support the wife he loves, Kia, and their two sons, Javon and Darren, he has a older daughter, Ariel, and his mean, cruel and manipulative mother with cancer is looked after in a nursing home. However, matters have begun to spiral out of his control, he cannot compete with a rival business that has taken his customers and contracts, the nursing home need the kind of money he does not have, Ariel does not have the college fees she requires, and his sons have essential needs too.Unwilling to see his family and children's future go down the pan, Bug is all too susceptible to joining a dodgy diamond heist organised by Ronnie and Reggie Sessions, his past dealings with them had not ended well. However, these are not normal times, he is a man with few choices, although if the truth be told he has missed his old life, the sheer excitement of it making him feel so vibrantly alive. He is haunted by a love of his father, a gifted wheelman too, who left him and his mother when he was a child. The ghost and precious memories of his father have been fundamental to Bug throughout his life, his success in emulating him he took as a sign of approval that had sustained and built his sense of self esteem, but he is all too blind to his father's serious flaws. If Bug had entertained thoughts that he could keep the two sides of his life, the criminal and his family, apart, he is to be cruelly disillusioned, as the repercussions of the heist threatens his life and bring deadly danger to everyone who matters.This is a gritty and atmospheric crime read, you cannot help feeling for and empathising with Beauregard, an intelligent black man whose life and expectations has been defined by the racism endemic in Virginia, he wants his children to have what he didn't have, a stress free childhood and the freedom to be all that they could be. This is a book that is just begging to be turned into a film, it is an action packed thrill ride, with bags of suspense and tension, as you wonder if Bug will survive, and even if he does, what kind of life will he have left?

That rough, whiskey-soaked melodic voice that haunted his daydreams. But the words belonged to someone far more eloquent that he couldn\u2019t recall. He ran his finger over the hood of the Duster. People had been shot. They might even be dead. There was going to be major heat coming down after such a brazen robbery in broad daylight. He had a feeling Ronnie was going to try and fuck him over for his cut. Quan was a fucking train wreck.But they had gotten away. He still had it. Whatever \u2018it\u2019 was.\u2018We are who we were meant to be\u2019 he said.\u201dBeauregard Montage is a loving father, a dedicated husband, a terrific mechanic, but that isn\u2019t who he really is. He can tamp it down, ignore the fierce need, and the siren call of the blacktop, but the man he really is can\u2019t exist in tandem with the man his family needs him to be. Those on the opposite side of the law from the East coast to Florida to Mississippi know the best wheelman is Bug Montage. Behind the wheel, he is Fred Astaire, Rambo, and the Black Panther all rolled into one package. If you try to stay with him while attempting to catch him, you will find yourself flipping, rolling, smashing as you miss the turn he made with ease. You might find yourself in a body cast, wishing you\u2019d never, ever laid eyes on his taillights. Beauregard can get away; the question is, Can he stay uncaught. \u201dDon\u2019t get killed. Don\u2019t get caught.\u201dThings would have been fine if Precision Auto hadn\u2019t moved into town with their rock bottom prices. Montage\u2019s business went from good enough to pay the bills to a ghost town. Not only are the bills piling up at the shop, but they are at home, too. To make matters worse, the old folks home wants to toss his mother out. If there is any reason to pick up robbery again, it is the thought of his mother moving into the house. She has a mouth on her that would make a marine sergeant shudder. Beauregard also struggles with his memories of his father, his own inherited violent Montage tendencies, and those same tendencies beginning to show up in his son. So when Ronnie and Reggie Sessions come to him wanting his help taking down a big score at a jewelry store, he is a desperate man, on the verge of seeing everything he has worked so hard to build go up in flames. Why shouldn\u2019t he use his god-given talent to make things right, to give himself some breathing room? Besides, when it really comes down to it...he loves the game. He knows Ronnie is always working some angle. Mrs. Montage didn\u2019t raise no fool, but Beauregard thinks he can stay one step ahead of his scheming mind. The robbery turns into a shit storm, but the cops are clueless. The problem is, they just robbed a front for one of the baddest gangsters in the South. The gangster boss is vaguely amused by their antics, but he wants his diamonds back. And then things really turn to shit. I first heard about this book when I was watching a zoom event with Stephen King and James Lee Burke. I\u2019ve read a lot of books by these guys, so this was a real treat for me to watch them together. King is a big fan of Burke\u2019s work and was very complimentary, as he usually is, for the writings of other authors. He made a point of encouraging people to pick up this book. I\u2019m so glad he mentioned it because it was so reassuring for me to read a neo-noir book being published in 2020. I feel like there has been a dearth of hardboiled, gritty mysteries being published in recent years. It is obvious to me, while reading this book, that S. A. Cosby has a real love for the genre, and that he has read extensively in the genre. This is a wild ride with wonderful twists and turns and not just when Montage is behind the wheel. The only thing missing is a femme fatale to throw one more monkey wrench into an already messed up situation. I bet he gets to her in his next book. Buckle up buttercup, and hop in Montage\u2019s Plymouth Duster, and wait for him to hit the nitro. You\u2019ll be rolling like a rocket through the blacktop wasteland. You\u2019ll hear the sirens recede until the only thing you\u2019re listening to is the whistling of the wind through a crack in the window seal. You\u2019ll feel that occasional wobble as the car navigates the soft swells of the rolling hills. You\u2019ll feel a singing in your blood. You\u2019ll look over at Beauregard and match his grin with your own. \u201dGet in. Get Out.

However, he left that life behind to be a husband and father, and he started his own automotive repair shop in rural Virginia. Unfortunately, business has gotten slow, and the bills are piling up. That\u2019s when an old associate who burned Bug on a previous heist shows up with the promise of an easy score. Feeling that he has no other options, Bug decides to do the job even though he has grave concerns about who he\u2019ll be working with.What could possibly go wrong?I wrote about how S.A. Cosby came to my attention at the 2019 Bouchercon in my review of his first book, My Darkest Prayer, and with his second book he continues to deliver.The idea of a former criminal trying to go straight who takes one last job has certainly been done before in crime fiction. Cosby hits all the familiar beats with the planning, the heist, the twist, all the other elements you\u2019d see in a Richard Stark novel, and he does them well. As just a crime novel this makes for a helluva page turner.Where the book hits the next gear (Get it?) is in the character work done with Bug, and it\u2019s all about the relationships. First, there\u2019s the daddy issues with Bug being haunted by his unresolved feelings for his father, a criminal who vanished at a critical moment in Bug\u2019s youth. Then there\u2019s the hateful dying mother he feels obligated to support. Finally, there\u2019s the wife and kids he dearly loves and is trying to make a brighter future for.Like many a character in a crime fiction like this, Bug claims he\u2019s doing it all for his loved ones, but there\u2019s a part of him that also loves the outlaw life. It also fits his violent tendencies better than being a family man, and one of the key things that Cosby digs into here is the notion of a person split between two conflicting lifestyles that are fundamentally opposed. In the end the book is really about Bug coming to terms with who he really is, who he wants to be, and what kind of damage he\u2019s already done to the people he loves.In addition to all this, the writing just absolutely cooks. There\u2019s great action, gritty violence, humor, heartbreaking moments, and while reading there were some driving sequences where I found myself pressing my foot on the floor as if I could stomp the brake to slow the car down. I grew up in a rural area, and I may have broken a few speed limits on country roads in my youth so Cosby\u2019s descriptions of what that rush is like really hit home for me,It\u2019s a fantastic follow up to his first novel, and it makes me more sure than ever that Cosby is a writer to watch.", "num_likes": 87, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["arc", "crime-mystery", "bad-guys-rule", "thieves"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3263498522", "review_id": "3263498522", "date": "Apr 04, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Fabian", "user_url": "/user/show/1036893-fabian", "text": "As unputdownable as any work of modern fiction has the right to be.

Opens his own repair shop, but then the other shoe drops and money, well money though the root of all evil, needs to be paid. Hugs is out of options.I loved the way this author treated Bugs and others so compassionately. Shows how sometimes despite ones intentions, life doesn't go as planned. Traps await and bills come due, options limited. How even a good man can be stretched, stressed to the limit and turn to something he wished he didn't have to do. Even that though, doesn't turn out the way one would expect. Now but trouble comes calling.

And, when I say great, you better believe it. It harkens back to all the top caper novels. It's all about a guy named Beauregard Montage, better known as \"Bug.\" And, Bug is just trying to go straight, to life a good life, be a good husband, a good father. But, as Springsteen once said, he's got debts no honest man can pay. He's going to lose the garage business he's built up over the years since he got out. And, maybe, if he pulled one last job, he'd be able to provide for his family. See, Bug is a driver. He's a driver like Steve McQueen is a driver and no one is at one with a set of wheels like Bug. But, see the thing is when you're desperate you don't have the luxury of picking your jobs and you can't pick your partners. The job ain't planned out to the second like Bug wants and his partners are trying out for a walk on part in Goodfellas. Like any good noir novel, you can already sense the whirlpool starting and you know it's all going to go sideways. Bug is like a drowning man without a damn life preserver.

In the case of the book, it has your name written all over it and once again, before you know it, it's in your hand and every book you own before it, goes back one place in your reading order. Attempt at humor aside, I sincerely thank Flatiron Books, Edelweiss, and S. A. Cosby (Shawn A.), for the privilege to read an advance copy of Blacktop Wasteland. Lucky readers waiting to get their hands on a book worth all its hype in diamonds, Blacktop Wasteland hit all your favorite places to get your books on July 14th. Go get it! The Line - Sorry, put publishers frown at quoting from an arc though I doubt much has changed from the published work than the arc I read. Just know there are lots of memorable lines in this one. The Sinker - Those of you who follow me know I'm not going to give you a long plot summary. You'll find most of what you need to know by reading the blurbs and the pro reviews. Just sit down in your favorite reading place and open the book. Hooked from page one, Blacktop Wasteland never lost its momentum. Cosby sets the scene in the rural fictional town of Red Hill, VA (reminds me of Hampton Roads). The main protagonist, Beauregard, \u201cBug\u201d is one of those bad guys you hate to love. Along with partners in crime, a crew of outright criminals, and some just trying to live the life, this cast of characters leapt off the pages while Beauregard presses the pedal to the medal in a deliciously complex heist. Blacktop Wasteland is fast paced, gritty, and written in dialog that fits its settings and improves its plot. Beauregard does get into some questionable scrapes. \u201cCould that really happen?\u201d and then I remember seeing something like that on Myth Busters and it could but \u201cdon't try this from home\u201d. I might have had to suspend belief a bit but I was happy doing so. Fans and critics alike are saying \u201cmovie\u201d.

Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage, is the guy you root for. He has a troubled past, but is a devoted father and husband trying to make an honest living. When his past comes knocking, he is pulled back into a life he had sworn off. What stands out to me the most about this book is that a lot of the substance can be overlooked because of the many action scenes (this book was jam packed with them!!). While this isn't a bad thing - (sometimes subliminal messages about how someone else lives are helpful in nudging a reader to think differently about the world) - it definitely takes work on the part of the reader to truly digest all that is within the pages. However, what resonated with me the most was that it highlights the systemic issue of poverty and how that infects every part of your life and makes it ten times harder to overcome a problem that comes your way. It forces an individual or family to make a choice between bad and terrible. Food on the table or medication for your child? Rent for the month or a car repair bill so you can get to work? Life saving medication for yourself or long term care bill for your ailing parent? So many people in our country and across the world face these decisions every day and have no help. Everything that takes place in this book stems from issues with money and it is passed on from generation to generation because no one is able to get ahead enough to stop it completely. It further opened my eyes to how important it is to yes, have compassion for people who are in these situations, but how much more important it is to work towards providing economic opportunities for communities that have been left behind. Bug and his family personified these circumstances and it could not have been written any better. A few notes to the reader considering this excellent book. Please do not be swayed into thinking it is a thriller. It is pure and simple a crime drama and beyond that exploration of what I discussed above. Attica Locke and Steve Cavanagh come to mind for work that is similar so if you like those author's books, you should seek this one out. Lastly, take your time when reading this. It's easy to turn those pages as quick as can be because of how the action sucks you in and grabs your attention, but deliberate reading here is necessary. The author is writing brilliantly a story that is all too common. I urge you to add this to your reading list. Particularly, this summer. Don't walk, don't run - drive like your life depended on it (or in a quarantine - get to your computer) and order a copy as soon as you can. This book will blow you away.Thank you to Flatiron Books for sending me an e-galley to read and provide an honest review. Thank you also to S.A.

You want him to get away with it. You want him to succeed. \u201cBlacktop Wasteland\u201d is that sort of book, with Bug, the main character, possessing the intentions of being a good father, a solid businessman, a loving husband. Yes, he\u2019s done some bad things, but he\u2019s trying to leave those things behind. When the story opens, Bug (Beauregard) owns an auto repair shop. He was barely getting by until a competitor pops up and undercuts his business. Adding to that, his daughter wants to go to college and his mother is in a nursing home and behind on her fees. One son needs braces and the other needs glasses. He\u2019s feeling economic pressure. He\u2019s been on the straight and narrow path for years. His inner musings provide the reader with his anguish of doing everything right, and still not maintaining a decent living standard.Author S.A. Cosby sets his story in Virginia, where the Confederate flag is plentiful and people still call him \u201cboy\u201d. Bug is black and feels the inequities his race provides. Cosby doesn\u2019t pontificate about racial injustice in this novel. He shows it in everything Bug attempts to do. At one point in the story, Bug is remembering a discussion he had with his daddy:\u201cListen, when you\u2019re black in America you live with the weight of people\u2019s low expectations on your back every day\u2026\u2026Think about it like it\u2019s a race. Everybody else has a head start and you dragging those low expectations behind you.\u201dBug is known in the criminal world as being the best get-away driver in the South. A past acquaintance comes to him with a scheme to steal a cache of diamonds. The guy has an in at a jewelry store, and he needs a driver. If there is a flaw in the story. It\u2019s that Bug actually decides to work with this idiot. Bug is clearly smart; when he decides to collaborate with this loser, I was skeptical. If you get past that, Cosby takes you on a very interesting car chase and getaway story. Cosby knows about cars, and he writes a mean road action story. It was like reading scenes from \u201cSmokey and Bandit\u201d without the comedy portion. Bug is an amazing driver, and half the cleverness of the novel is his driving skills. This is a gritty story that is both action-packed and a bit depressing. Bug is fighting against poverty and bad guys. All through the story we read about his dichotomy of wanting to be a good man and a provider against the allure of the life of crime. This conflict gnaws on his conscious throughout the novel. This is marketed as a crime novel, but I feel it\u2019s a contemporary story of economic desperation.", "num_likes": 68, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["adult-fiction", "crime-mystery", "southern-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3388603245", "review_id": "3388603245", "date": "Jun 22, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Elle", "user_url": "/user/show/70046142-elle", "text": "Holy shit this was good. Literally from the first chapter this book went off like a firecracker and never let up. Beauregard Montage might be the most inherently badass character I\u2019ve ever come across while reading, all in a way that doesn\u2019t feel contrived by the author. I\u2019ve been lamenting lately that the Thriller genre has been too homogenous, and I know I\u2019m not the only one who feels that way. Blacktop Wasteland is a crime thriller that\u2019s full of memorable characters, intensity and a whole lot of heart-racing action. The novel follows Beauregard, a former notorious getaway driver, as he\u2019s tried to settle into the quiet life with his family. Through circumstances both within and outside of his control, he finds himself in constantly escalating situations that put the life he\u2019s built in danger. The world he\u2019s left behind is not for the light-hearted. It\u2019s harsh and ruthless and left me audibly gasping multiple times. Not everyone is cut out for that type of environment. The tone is set right away; you\u2019ll know if this is a book you\u2019d like by the end of chapter one. As a character, Bug\u2019s strength has an quiet quality to it\u2014understated until it isn\u2019t. He\u2019s easy to identify with and there\u2019s a good amount of second-hand catharsis whenever he catches up with those who did him wrong.Literally BeauregardI also liked that Beau didn\u2019t try to hide what was happening from his wife, Kia. He wasn\u2019t necessarily forthcoming and didn\u2019t go into detail, but I feel like that\u2019s more because she didn\u2019t want to know specifics. Any questions she had, he more or less answered. I fully expected him to just lie to her face about both the heist and what Javon did, but was pleasantly surprised when he told her immediately. The one thing I wish S.A. Cosby did differently is give Kia a little more to do in this story. She\u2019s the loving but no-nonsense wife who \u2018worries about him\u2019. Her and the kids\u2019 role is reduced to being liabilities that Beauregard needs to protect. I honestly think this book would struggle to pass the Bechdel Test.In all, though, I absolutely loved this. It\u2019s well-plotted and paced and totally captivating. Natalie (@bookreadreciepts) and I did this as a buddy read, and even her stingy butt gave it 5 stars! If you\u2019re looking for a gripping and action-packed thriller (thats not centered around a drunk white lady or a \u2018rogue cop\u2019), I definitely recommend Blacktop Wasteland.*Thanks to Flatiron Books & Netgalley for an advance copy!", "num_likes": 66, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2020", "netgalley"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3666228413", "review_id": "3666228413", "date": "Apr 09, 2021", "rating": 5, "user_name": "PorshaJo", "user_url": "/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "text": "Wow!

That is until a rival shop opens and Bug is loosing business. He needs money or his shop will close. His mother needs to remain in home care but due to an oversight (on purpose) on her part to not declare some money, he needs a lot of money to pay for her care or she's shipped out. His daughter, wants to go to college but needs money. Bug wants her to leave and get out of the place where he sees nothing good for her, he wants her to leave and never look back. All these money troubles lead Bug to make one decision that changes the lives of so many people. One small decision to commit a crime that continues to spiral out of control. And it was all due to Ronnie Friggin Sessions!A great buddy read that we both loved and can't stop thinking about. The audio was a deep, strong voice that added so much to the narration. A gritty, violent, heartbreaking story that we couldn't put down. When the story started out and they were drag racing for money I thought eh, not my thing. But it immediately went to violence and the story picked up pretty quickly. I was shocked, enthralled, and sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next. After you meet Ronnie Friggin Sessions you just know it's all going bad. I just didn't realize how far it would go. I'm very stingy with 5 star reads but I can't give this one anything less.

Are we what our parents were or can we escape from the things that made our parents life unhappy, dangerous, and terrifying?Bug Montage is a family man, so in love with his wife and a father working hard as a car mechanic to make it all come together.

He doesn't want a repeat of the life his father had, a father he loved even though he had been deserted by him, and yet he needed to provide for his beloved family.One of Bug's myriad talents is his uncanny ability to drive, a reputation based on his other persona of having been a getaway driver.

That\u2019s the way he raised me.\u201dHe\u2019s done jobs, and done time, but now he\u2019s got a good garage and a straight business. Unfortunately a competition chain garage has opened up and is attracting his customers away. He and wife Kia and kids are scraping bottom, about to lose everything. He is a devoted family man \u2013 a corny, over-worked phrase, but true for Bug, as he\u2019s known. This is a book where status is measured in single-wides, double-wides, and some actual houses. A developer may park a few trailers on an empty space in the country and call it a trailer park. After the 2008 recession, this Virginia town\u2019s employers, the corporations, moved offshore to \u201ccut expenses by half while doubling profits. The empty buildings stood like forgotten monoliths to a lost civilization. The ice plant, the insulation plant, the flag factory and the elastic plant were hardly discernible anymore. Mother Nature was reclaiming her land with steady, implacable persistence. The pine trees and the dogwoods and the honeysuckle and the kudzu were slowly but surely enveloping the old buildings in an arboreal embrace.\u201dSuccess seems to be measured by survival of the scariest. When he\u2019s offered a \u2018job\u2019, Kia begs him to stay home, stay clean, sell the Duster. Never. That's his Daddy's '71 Plymouth Duster that he loves and races to pick up money here and there. The lure of the job is too strong, the alternative of losing everything too dire. He trusts nobody, but he needs the money. The jobs are all violent and bloody. Be warned.\u201cBeauregard knew there was no honor among thieves. Boys in the game only respected you in direct proportion to how much they needed you divided by how much they feared you. There was no doubt they needed his skill.And if they weren\u2019t a little bit afraid of him, then that was their mistake.\u201dI like cars and racing (other people driving!) which made it a visual experience for me. This is a screenplay waiting for a director and drivers, if they aren\u2019t already lined up. Scenes are spelled out as guts are spilled out. \u201c[X] had barely closed the door all the way when Beauregard took off, tires squealing and leaving a cloud of gray smoke in his wake. The Buick sailed out of the parking lot doing 40. Beauregard slammed on the brakes and the gas as he twisted the steering wheel to the right. There were only a few cars on the street this time of morning. Beauregard careened around them going up on the sidewalk then back to the street. He ran a red light and [X] screamed as he threaded the needle between a jacked-up good ol\u2019 boy truck and a short-body delivery van.Beauregard gripped the steering wheel like it was life preserver. He could feel the vibrations of the engine radiating through the wheel and up his arms. His heart wasn\u2019t pounding. He guessed it wasn\u2019t doing more than 70 beats per minute. This was where he belonged. Where he excelled. Some people were meant to pound the keys on a piano or strum the strings of a guitar. A car was his instrument and he was performing a symphony. A coldness filled him. It started in his stomach and spread to his extremities. He knew no matter what happened he would never feel more alive, more present than he felt at this moment. There was truth in that idea and sadness too.\u201dThis is a grim, exciting, terrifying, bone-crunching, breath-taking ride, and a heart-breaking open wound of a story. I hated it and loved it. Horrendous and wonderful. I so want it not to be a way of life, but if I\u2019m going to read about it, this is what I\u2019d choose.

Immediately upon starting this book, I recognized the telltale signs of a character-driven story for the sake of emotional investment. I\u2019m an emotional reader. I approach my reads with my heart on my sleeve and a willingness to surrender it easily. This book made it clear, right away, I was signing up to have my feelings wrecked and I wasn\u2019t angry about it. I was ready, eagerly anticipating the journey to destruction.The first neon sign was the main protagonist, Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage. I like Bug. He\u2019s street smart and savvy. He\u2019s been with his wife since they were kids and now they have kids of their own; a dedicated family man with a solid work ethic but with this wise-ass, \u201ctake-no-shit\u201d persona as a remnant from his previous lifestyle.S.A. Cosby does an excellent job bringing the reader into Bug\u2019s day-to-day schedule and pulling back the curtain on his personal life so that we can share in his intimate relationships with his mama, his wife, and kids and his extended family and friends.There\u2019s also some seriously developed backstory as Cosby deals with themes of generational addictions: fathers passing on their self-destructive behaviors to their sons and so on and so on. Like all good crime noir dramas, the stage is set for conflict.There\u2019s no right or wrong here. There is only gray area as readers are forced to ask themselves, what would you do if you were forced to choose between a rock and a hard place? Thankfully, Bug is a complex, fully-fleshed out individual who makes some decisions that readers will choose to agree or disagree with; either way, you want Bug to be successful, which is a true sign of the author\u2019s authenticity to the human condition.The narrative goes from zero to sixty. It is exhilarating and nerve-wracking.Did the author deliver on the emotional wreckage I assumed was coming for me? Yes. Was it what I expected? No. This story is full of ups and downs, highs and lows, victories, and losses. It\u2019s one of those crime dramas that leaves a lasting impact on your mood much like a Dennis Lehane or James Ellroy novel. I carried around a heaviness in my heart for quite some time after I turned the last page.I recommend this book for those who are looking to read adrenaline-pumping heist stories, intense car chases (some of the best driving scenes since I watched the movie Drive), good guys that act like bad guys and bad guys with heart, Black authors telling their own stories and just a damn good story told by a damn good writer.", "num_likes": 41, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3478843511", "review_id": "3478843511", "date": "Aug 04, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Kathleen", "user_url": "/user/show/47188780-kathleen", "text": "Fasten your seatbelt!

It's that good! To say this book's release is timely is an understatement, but the release date doesn't matter. In my opinion, this story was destined for the best seller list the moment Cosby penned \"The End\". Blacktop Wasteland is raw, graphic, and authentic. It seeps into your heart and soul refusing to turn loose, always calling, much the same way Beauregard (Bug) Montage's ghosts whisper in his head, luring him back to a life of crime first learned at his father's side. One that fuels his need for high speed, screaming tires and motors, curvy roads - all for just one more high-octane adrenaline rush and some much needed funds. Bug's tried to go straight - to break the chains of poverty and make a good, honest living for his wife and kids, but the mortgage on his car shop is due, his mother is one day away from being kicked out of a nursing home, and his money is funny. One more driving job will get him out of debt so he rolls the dice one more time. Will it be one time too many? S.A. Cosby held me in the palm of his hands from the beginning to the end of Blacktop Wasteland. I couldn't look away or stop reading as he wrung every drop of blood, sweat, and tears out of these characters imprisoned by poverty, race, and reality. The story is emotionally draining, the anguish real, and the author doesn't pull any punches in delivering it. With a plot line more twisted than a curvy, southern back road, readers ride shotgun in a souped up car on a trail of desolation. Cosby nails the setting - rich with the scent of motor oil, sound of screaming tires and grinding shifters, and trails of smoke in taillights. Bugs point of view drives home the dire situation he's facing - the hopelessness and desperation, the need and determination. Blacktop Wasteland is a fantastic example of grit lit done right. It will knock you down and break your heart . . . and yet somehow, leave you with a ray of hope. A fantastic story that deserves all the attention and accolades I hope it receives.

It was brilliantly fresh and original to me. A real standout for my 2020 reading. Kudos to the author. Our main character \"Bug\" is known as the best getaway driver east of the Mississippi, or at least was. He is making a living being a mechanic, a father, a son, and a husband, until he returns to some old ways to help dig himself out of debt and poverty. This book feels like having the rug pulled out from under you again and again. It's like trying to climb a ladder with each rung breaking as you go. It's a reminder of what it feels like to feel like you have no options. Each paragraph is incredibly telling and includes not only the obvious window into the lives of those experiencing economic crisis and prejudices but also has you reading between the lines for stories and back stories hidden within. It is a reminder that sometimes as parents it\u2019s no longer about us, that we would do anything for our children. It is a reminder of what family and blood both mean. This book has one of the strongest most action packed last quarters, maybe even halves, that I have read in a long time. It is scene after scene of action. It is very descriptive and graphic, and incredibly engrossing. Incredibly fast paced. Actually though, my favorite parts were the parts of him being dedicated to his family and wife and the dynamics there. I actually would have liked a little more of those parts. If you are here for the action then you have come to the right place with this book. I do tend to lean more towards family saga so I am not surprised that those were the parts I enjoyed most. I do have one critique and I'm sure it is my own sensitivity to the subject matter and that it was used for emphasis, but I strongly disliked the rant against someone of the LGBTQ+ community, and multiple notations and derogatory terms used. I understand there were most likely other terms that I overlooked or that didn't draw as much attention for me personally, but I think this book would have been equally as good had the terminology been different or the scenarios been a little different.Huge thanks to Goodreads and Flatiron Books for providing giveaways.

But what really gets his motor running (pardon the pun) is working as a getaway driver, and he's damn good at it too. It runs in the family: his father was the best in the business before he ran out on him and his Mom, many years ago, and he stills remembers his old man as a legend. Beauregard has tried to put his criminal past behind him - these days he lives a quieter life with his girlfriend and two young sons. However, the bills are piling up and he's in danger of losing the shop. When the opportunity of a lucrative diamond heist comes his way, he decides that it's too good to turn down. Even though it means teaming up with the shady Ronnie Sessions, this one final scheme can solve all of his financial woes. Or so he tells himself. He also can't shake the feeling that driving fast cars from the scene of the crime is the only thing he's really good at.Looking over that synopsis, Blacktop Wasteland sounds like a familiar story wrapped around a whole bunch of clich\u00e9s. A reformed criminal trying his best to turn his life around, one last job that sucks him back in. But it succeeds: the dialogue is snappy, the twists keep coming, and Beauregard is the anti-hero you can't help rooting for. Even though he's a felon, he's got principles. There is a decent man beneath all of the law-breaking, if he could just resist the lure of the dark side.

The past comes knocking on his door with an opportunity for one more job with a massive pay day. After reading and loving Razorblade Tears last year, this was high on my TBR.What you see is what you get. You know the players. You know the stakes. No twists or surprises. But I was still enthralled by the story and characters. It's definitely a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. Like a Fast and Furious movie but with much more heart. Speaking of movie, a film adaptation for this will be led by Virgil Williams and John Legend's production company.4.5 stars, rounding up. The writing was mostly flawless despite the excessive use of similes.

You were always looking over your shoulder. You always kept a gun within reach.\u201dBlacktop Wasteland is a thrilling, adrenaline-fueled read that gives a fresh new take on the One Last Job\u2122 premise. S.A. Cosby's pitch-perfect debut novel is brutal, twisty, and hella gritty. Blacktop Wasteland will have you at edge-of-your-seat from its very first chapter\u2014in which our 'hero' takes part in a drag race\u2014until the novel's finish line. Although Cosby's noir narrative is reminiscent of Walter Mosley and Dennis Lehane, his dynamic voice brings something new to the crime fiction scene.Set in a small-town in rural Virginia, Blacktop Wasteland follows Beauregard Montagerom, nicknamed Bug, a family man who works as a mechanic at his own garage. Beauregard's attempt to live an honest life is hindered by money troubles: business is bad and unforeseen expenses keep cropping up. Going against his wife's wishes, Beauregard agrees to one last job. The heist, however, doesn't go quite as planned...and things rapidly go south.Blacktop Wasteland has a lot to offer: an action-packed storyline, charged dialogues, and compelling yet morally grey\u2014if not downright corrupt\u2014characters.This is one gripping novel. While things do get violent and messy, Cosby manages to vividly render Beauregard's complicated family dynamics, as well as the motivations of those connected to the heist. The way the story unfolds took me by surprise, and in the latter half of the novel, my jaw may have hit the floor once or twice.Alongside some pretty epic moments\u2014Beauregard, for all his faults, is one smooth guy\u2014the story manages to pack quite a few emotional punches. Cosby doesn't shy away from portraying the stark realities of crime, poverty, and racism.Cosby's descriptions were terrific, especially where cars were concerned (\u201cthe car shivered like a wolf shaking its pelt\u201d , \u201cthe motor went from a roar to the war cry of a god\u201d). They could also be startlingly humorous (such as \u201cexplanations were like assholes. Everyone has one and they are all full of shit\u201d).Reading Blacktop Wasteland felt like being taken on an exhilarating ride. This novel is smart, dark, funny, and\u2014as previously mentioned\u2014seriously gritty.Read more reviews on my blog\u00a0/ / /\u00a0View all my reviews on Goodreads", "num_likes": 32, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["overdrive-ebooks", "iii-favourites", "owned-audiobooks", "2020-reviews", "favourite-protagonists", "own", "lgbtqia-side"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3518962238", "review_id": "3518962238", "date": "Sep 03, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Pantelis Andreou", "user_url": "/user/show/37924577-pantelis-andreou", "text": "Thank god i discovered that a few weeks ago and decided to give it a chance!By reading the description i immediately decided to order it and boy oh boy what a pleasant surprise this was!

Cosby\u2019s new novel is your run-of-the-mill crime tale. It tells the story of a talented getaway driver who\u2019s gotten out of the crime life to become a dedicated family man and mechanic and is pulled back in for another heist once the bills start piling up. You might think that you\u2019ve read something like this before and you\u2019d be correct. This story has been written before, but the big difference is that I doubt that it was written with such heart and soul. This is a standout, breakout novel that not only is impeccably paced and completely entertaining, but it also dives deep into character, creating a protagonist and a supporting cast that linger long after the last page.Beauregard Montage is a great protagonist, a man struggling to reckon with his past and with his unexplained abandonment by his father, and a man whose desire to make a better life for his children comes into conflict with his suspicions that he can never outrun his violent life and criminal tendencies. Beauregard carries the story, but every other character is just as well-drawn, whether it was the sleazy brothers Reggie and Ronnie or even the unseen but just as present character of Beauregard\u2019s long-gone father. Anchored by confident, rugged writing and well-conceived, riveting action and car chase scenes, this is a fast-paced and entertaining read that should launch S.A.

This gritty crime novel had me wrapped up in the life of Beauregard Montage and his family. I felt bad for Beau, whose father left him a legacy of failed criminal, failed father, and a fondness for driving fast cars. Beauregard's auto repair shop is super slow thanks to the new place down the street, and his bills are piling up. His mom's in a nursing home and his son needs braces. His daughter from a previous relationship is trying to go to college and that costs money too. His vows to live an above board life are now paling in the light of burgeoning responsibilities. His wife thinks he should sell his souped-up Plymouth Duster, but he won't because that's the only part of his dad he has left. He decides to do one more \"job.\" You know, just this one time only, to help he and his family get over this financial hump. I think we all know how that turns out.I loved this book, I loved the characters, even the ones I hated, and I was pulling for Beauregard. I'm not sure why, exactly, but I know that he loved his family and he was going to do his best for them, no matter what. (I will admit to admiring his devious mind and his prodigious driving skills.) I also very much enjoyed the word play and similes that popped up throughout. At one point, Beau's bill pile was growing so much that it was described as financial tectonic plate movement. I laughed out loud at that one, because who hasn't been there? It's a perfect and vivid description that I could immediately relate to while still being succinct.For me, personally, this book brought me back to when I was about 8-10 years old. I was a daddy's girl and sometimes on Saturdays my dad brought me down to my uncle's auto repair shop while he worked on a car or two. (It was either the repair shop or the pool hall, where I'd rack them up for Shirley Temples and Pacman money, but that's another story.) My dad instilled in me a love for American Muscle cars, (as long as they weren't Fords), and I harbor that love to this very day. I was on the edge of my seat until the very end of this tale; the suspense was palpable, and I had to stop what I was doing and listen to the last half hour with no interruptions. The narrator, Adam Lazarre-White, had me captivated with his deep voice and I just could not pull myself away until it was all over.

It's a twist on the gangster story, tho Beauregard/Bug is a freelancer rather than on any particular side there's enough organized crime here to more than qualify. And there's the classic \"career criminal pulling one last job\" trope on top of that. Add to that some of the gritty Southern subgenre, this book is deep in its rural Virginia setting, and it's a welcome addition as so much of this area is dominated by white writers, which certainly doesn't accurately reflect the rural South. It's about fathers and sons and the legacy of crime and violence. Oh, and also add a good splash of The Fast and the Furious in there for good measure. Sometimes I'll say in a review that a book would make a good movie, but this book is screaming to be made into a movie and oh boy would I watch it.All those subgenres and tropes I mentioned, none of them are particular favorites of mine. But the thing about a good book is that none of that matters if it's good. It's when it doesn't work that you just can't find yourself committing to something that doesn't fall directly into your wheelhouse. I love a good crime novel, I particularly love one with minimal law enforcement (hardly any cops here!), but all the rest of it isn't at the top of my list, which may be why this wasn't originally on my radar. But then I read the first chapter, which takes place at an illegal street race, and even though that is not something that perks my interest, I was hooked by the time it was over. Right out of the gate Cosby shows you that this is a book grounded in a world he knows well and that this book is going to be slick as hell and you'd better get ready for what's coming. This is where you insert the \"buckle your seatbelt\" joke.Action scenes are hard to write well, and action scenes in cars are harder. But I felt like Cosby guided me through all of them (so many! so much action!) really well. The two most impressive were complex but I could see them in my mind despite how unusual they were. More than that, he's very smart at occasionally switching our POV to let us know when something is definitely not about to go as planned to up the tension. Beauregard/Bug is your classic action hero in a lot of ways. He's a mix of hyper-competent criminal, quiet idea guy, and family man. He knows the life is no good, he wants to be better and is trying to do it, but he's also hung up on memories of his father and the need to support his family. There is one very clear and obvious solution to his problems that he refuses to accept because the truth is he's not ready to let go of that life. As I mentioned, this can be a tiresome trope, but Cosby keeps you grounded in both sides of Beauregard, letting you see clearly the appeal of both aspects of his life while also making it clear that it's impossible to have both. Both sides of the narrative are also appealing and, let's be honest, the criminal stuff is exciting to read, you're anxious to get to it just like Beauregard is, the momentum of the story itself draws you into him.We have been talking a lot lately about reading diversely and how to be an antiracist reader. I am a big believer in reading widely and not limiting your stories by Black authors to stories of suffering and racism. BLACKTOP WASTELAND is a great example of a book that is extremely aware that its protagonist is Black, it effects his interactions with every character, and it's often part of whether he is hired for a job or how much he trusts the people he works with. It is intricately woven into the story because it is intricately woven into Beauregard's life. But the book is not about being Black just like a book about a white man in a similar situation is not about being white. Crime is a genre with very few known Black writers, which is a serious indictment of the publishing of crime novels, as so much of our actual criminal justice system is disproportionately focused on Black people being charged with crimes as well as often being victims of crime without being able to rely on the system that says it will protect them. Books like this one are part of how we change the genre and I would like dozens of them every year.Note for readers that this is a very violent book and not just in a car-crash-y kind of way. Also, the one downside of working in these types of stories is that women are relegated to wife/girlfriend, and generally symbolize a life of being tied down by obligation. Beauregard's wife Kia is more fully drawn than most, but she still doesn't get much of a life on the page outside of begging Beauregard to quit that life. My other major critique is that there was enough fatphobic/sizeist bits that I need to make a note of it here. It's so common for this to happen a handful of times in books that I would basically have to put the warning on everything. But here it's a regular happening, and while it's nice to have a book where there are several fat characters, it's not so nice to have them all regularly ridiculed for their size and even outside of dialogue the narration will describe their walk as a \"waddle\" so it isn't just the characters themselves. This is not actually a debut, Cosby's first novel was published with a small press in 2019 and I'm glad to see he's moved up to a bigger one here, he certainly deserves the spot. I immediately purchased his last book and I really hope he becomes a fixture in the genre.", "num_likes": 25, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["arc-provided-by-publisher", "authors-of-color", "crime-mystery"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3392666428", "review_id": "3392666428", "date": "Jun 24, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "OutlawPoet", "user_url": "/user/show/245365-outlawpoet", "text": "All too rarely, you read a book that actually lives up its buzz.

Bug knows there\u2019s no future in the man he used to be: known from the hills of North Carolina to the beaches of Florida as the best wheelman on the East Coast.He thought he'd left all that behind him, but as his carefully built new life begins to crumble, he finds himself drawn inexorably back into a world of blood and bullets. When a smooth-talking former associate comes calling with a can't-miss jewelry store heist, Bug feels he has no choice but to get back in the driver's seat. And Bug is at his best where the scent of gasoline mixes with the smell of fear.Haunted by the ghost of who he used to be and the father who disappeared when he needed him most, Bug must find a way to navigate this blacktop wasteland...or die trying.Like Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Drive, with a Southern noir twist, S. A. Cosby\u2019s Blacktop Wasteland is a searing, operatic story of a man pushed to his limits by poverty, race, and his own former life of crime.-----My take ...My second encounter with S. A. Cosby, after reading My Darkest Prayer a year or two ago. Subsequent to reading Blacktop Wasteland, I did enjoy his latest offering - Razorblade Tears. Once I had gotten my breath back that was. Blacktop Wasteland was one of those books, I was so looking forward to reading, but kept putting off actually doing so for a year. I'm quite strange in that I enjoy the anticipation of reading a book I think will be excellent, not as much as reading it of course, but still a bit of delayed gratification doesn't do me any harm. I may have to re-evaluate that approach as I get older for fear of missing out altogether.Was it worth the wait then? Abso-bloody-lutely. Really, really good. So good, I will have difficulty articulating just what it was exactly that I loved about it. I'll have a go though.... story, characters, pacing, conflict, dilemnas, family, ghosts of family, history, regrets, mistakes, Hobson's choice, decisions, necessity, loyalty, support, trust, betrayal, violence, opportunity, and outcome.I love a bit of outlaw fiction with good people forced to make hard choices due to economic pressures. Cosby sets up the story in such a fashion, that his main man Bug is left with little option other than reverting to one last job. That said he does have an alternative, but to choose it would be an anathema to his soul. Stubborn, obstinate, hard-hearted, talented, resourceful, capable, and intelligent. He's not a man to be pushed around.I enjoyed the planning and execution of the job. I liked Bug's issues with his partners and the dynamics between them all. There's an inevitability about things going pear-shaped and Bug finding himself with a massive target on his back. More issues to contend with. Another job to execute and another bigger hole to dig oneself out of.I found Blacktop Wasteland to be fast-moving, gripping, exciting, tense and extremely satisfying. If I had one eeny weeny criticism, it would be that for an intelligent man, Bug was just a little bit naive in some of his dealings during the book. I thought he was a bit too savvy to get suckered how he did.4.5 from 5I look forward to whatever Shawn Cosby does next (and maybe I'll read it as soon as I get the chance).

The bills are mounting, for his daughter in college, his mother in a retirement home, two young children and his crumbling auto repair business. Its an encouraging opening, and not just because of the plot, Cosby's theme is race, almost as if he has intentionally addressed the topics from the headlines in the last couple of months. From its promising beginning though, the plot turns hinge on poor decision making by Montage, and it isn't long before he loses any sympathy the reader has built up. Its afterword contains praise from well know authors of similar Southern Noir, Mosley, for example. It struggles to justify this though. The quality of the writing lacks the edge that those greats have with dialogue, and comes over as a tatty impersonation. The driving angle, which may work for some, came over as a type of Fast and Furious in a novel and was unconvincing. Cosby specialises in descriptive similes, sprinkled liberally throught with one every few pages. These typify the writing, and are very hit and miss. It seems he regularly and successfully builds the tension, then smashes it with what comes over a trashy comment. It lacks subtlety. The door opened like a crypt.

A stretch of desolate road. Ideal for drag racing. Or getaways. Presumably a metaphor for the life of the somewhat amusingly albeit memorably named Beauregard Montage, a one time low rent criminal, getaway driver extraordinaire, who left the Life in favor of the straight and narrow and is now a failing autoshop owner and a family man in desperate need of money. So how does one get back up financially? Well, since this is apparently once a criminal always a criminal sort of story, Mr. Montage decides to commit more crimes. And mind you, he has other options, legal options, such a remortgaging or (as per his wife\u2019s insistent suggestion) selling his beloved muscle car, but he vehemently refuses both, the latter on account of a potently sentimental attachment to his daddy, another low rent criminal who has disappeared on his wife and son when Beauregard was 12 and needed his dad the most. Despite all that, our protagonist is profoundly hung up on his daddy, ghost conversations and all. With a man of low character and a lead foot, who drove well, charmed easily and left once and for all. Way to pick your role models there. So needless to say, baby Montage grows up into some version of his daddy and, though he tries to be a good man, just can\u2019t seem to stay away from the Life. Oh, how often everyone mentions the Life. That means there are guns all over his doublewide, despite having two young children around. That means hooking up with criminals so trashy they make the Montages look like high society. Mostly that means making stupid decisions that endanger those around him, over and over and over again. Oh, Beauregard makes excuses for himself, it\u2019s genetic, he believes, the Montages propensity to violent conflict resolution, so now you have three generations of Montage criminals\u2026because of anger management\u2026seriously, that\u2019s pretty lame. And that\u2019s essentially the protagonist of the book here and since he is the main attraction and literally and figuratively the driver of the story, the reading enjoyment will be directly proportional to your enjoyment of Mr. Montage. So for me it was somewhat reduced. I certainly wouldn\u2019t garnish it with praise like some well known authors. Southern Noir they say, yeah, maybe. It\u2019s dark and testosterony. But it\u2019s also oh so trashy, country fried trailer trashy, between the Southern accents and the low end lingo, some of the most brutal crimes of this book are those the characters commit upon the English language. The driving angle is fun, I actually read this the day after watching Ford/Ferarri, another testosterony action fest so there\u2019s that racing element to get the spirits high, although the movie did a nicer job of putting you in the driver\u2019s seat. But who wants to read Fast and Furious the novel. Well, maybe someone does. And maybe that someone also likes the soul searching criminal, the man at war with himself and too dumb to win sort of stories. It isn\u2019t just stupidity either, we are told over and over again that are protagonist is in fact smart, demonstrated outwardly by his ability to do some basic math mentally and remember things well, plus he really knows a lot about cars. It\u2019s also that misguided sort of pride, the fronting and posturing. In the very first scene, Beauregard wins a drag race to make some much needed money instead of taking it and leaving, he gets into a completely unnecessary conflict to defend his integrity presumably and is almost immediately liberated of his winnings. You know, like that saying\u2026fool and his money. So you know right away the sort of man you\u2019re dealing with here and as the book proceeds he only seems to double down on this. Devoted father and spouse scenes alone aren\u2019t gonna cut it to offset the balance. The daddy\u2019s footsteps\u2026or tire threads\u2026are too irresistible. So anyway, I\u2019ve beaten up on Beauregard enough. And frankly the novel dishes out enough abuse on him already. Guess the gist of all this is\u2026the story didn\u2019t quite work for me, the characters were too trashy. It\u2019s like whatever the opposite of Ocean\u2019s movies as far as crime novels go. The writing was pretty good actually, consistently and at times distractingly smarter and more eloquent than the novel\u2019s denizens and, since it is Southern Noir, it\u2019s littered with funky and/or odd metaphors and such. But in the end, it\u2019s basically fast and Furious Dumb and Dumber style. Overtly masculine energy, lots of violence and action and significant literary pretentions, it\u2019s certain to attract some fans though. And some who'll like it best in the rear view mirror.

His role model since childhood has been his father, a phenomenal getaway driver, who passed the skill and the car over to Bug before his disappearance. We are introduced to a character with two opposing identities: the honest and familial Beauregard and Bug, the criminal enjoying the thrill of a fast drive.

Made better by the fact that to class this as \u201cjust\u201d a heist book feels woefully inadequate for a story that is also a fascinating character study, a heartfelt examination of whether we can ever truly change who we are, and just an all around fantastic novel. For those who are here for the heist plot, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Cosby\u2019s cleverly orchestrated heists (yes, there\u2019s more than one!) are beautifully choreographed and compelling, sort of like watching a ballet...if the stage were on fire and the dancers had to dodge bullets while executing perfect fouett\u00e9s.But don\u2019t sleep on the character-driven component of this story either. Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage is one of the most enthralling protagonists I\u2019ve encountered. His fascinating backstory and struggles to reconcile how Beauregard the family man and Bug the wheel man can exist as the same person are complex, compelling, and not just a little heartbreaking. The secondary characters also don\u2019t disappoint, from the ones you love to the ones you love to hate, Cosby has put together an action/thriller that somehow doesn\u2019t include a single phone-it-in stock character. Even those who follow hero/villain archetypes are uniquely wrought individuals in their own ways. Finally, I think this book presents a great opportunity to encourage everyone to read more books by authors of color other than just the ones that are specifically about race. Obviously I encourage everyone to educate themselves on racial issues, preferably via OwnVoices books. However, I also think it\u2019s important to not limit ourselves to reading authors of color only when they\u2019re teaching us about racial inequality. There are so many amazing books out there by authors of color (both fiction and nonfiction), which everyone should read just because they\u2019re damn good books. To support authors of color, we need to value their voices when talking about things other than just their race. And there are so many authors in this category doing incredible work who make this easy for us. Cosby\u2019s Blacktop Wasteland is an exceptional example of that.

It is a gritty crime novel that exists somewhere between hardboiled and noir, featuring a down-on-his-luck African American mechanic in the South who dives down a criminal rabbit hole in a desperate attempt to resurrect his fortunes and rescue his family. The world of the protagonist is painstakingly crafted with loving detail. The characters are rich and memorable. Poverty and systemic racism loom through the pages. Conceptually, it is a wonderful undertaking, and a contribution to the mystery/crime genre the likes of which we badly need more of.Alas, Cosby lets the narrative unravel as it goes. While the novel begins gritty and reasonably realistic, with a dimensional and flawed protagonist and a complicated network of vivid characters, the events of the story take on successively over-the-top dimensions, until it winds up straining credulity altogether. The conclusion still provokes empathy, but the story by that point has hurdled through so many implausible twists and turns that it is hard to retain edge-of-the-seat engagement. Moreover, the unraveling feels especially odd and frustrating because Cosby takes such careful pains to craft a tight, gritty world in the early going. By the end, everyone gets away with murder, coincidences and absurd action sequences are common, and I was left shaking my head.The core strength of Blacktop Wasteland is in the first hundred pages, and based on that power alone, I would recommend it to a general audience, especially to mystery and crime fiction readers. The unraveling toward the end robs the whole effort of the clarity and beauty that the novel deserves, but there is enough to like in these pages that I will certainly look to see what else S.A.

The premise is the same ol' story of a man trying to provide for his family but S.A. Cosby has given a new and refreshing action packed noir thriller. The base for a thrilling ride was set right in the first chapter. It made me think the entire book is going to be about races and fast cars but it takes a turn to the slow moral dilemma of a common man struggling with daddy issues and money problems. Next, it is all about him and his life. The point to note here is the author's detailing of the area and the life there. All the characters were unique and deep. Everyone was relatable and simple. People with simple emotions and simple desires. I felt that every character had their own style of humour. And author had his own style. While we are digging deep into the lives of these characters, the action starts. The heist sequence was so fast paced and thrilling, it was better than any visual scene. In between the action, the human quotient was explored deeply about friendship, betrayal, love and duty.In most parts, the story was suspenseful. But for me, the writing was difficult to comprehend. Maybe because it has so many details about things that I didn't know about. The cars and their parts etc. It takes some time to get accustomed with the lingo. It is not difficult but not a breezy read. I invested some time and effort in this book to mainly understand the setting & the life and I guess it was worth it. Towards the end, I did feel there was too much detailing at some places that came in the way of the action because I just couldn't wait. But that is just my preference.

The majority of my friends have given it 5 stars and the rest a solid 4 stars.The StrengthsI went into Blacktop Wasteland pretty blind outside of just knowing how well it was being received. Blacktop Wasteland turned out to be a really great crime novel. It was full of action and full of consequence, and I loved S.A. Cosby's voice.Blacktop Wasteland had a lot of surprises, too. I'm certain I said \"noooo\" out loud more than once!There was a lot of heart in Blacktop Wasteland. It makes me excited to see what Cosby does next.The WeaknessesHere is the part where I get purely subjective. Pretty early on I had Blacktop Wasteland pegged as a heist book. I am such a huge fan of heist stories, and I've been really craving them lately. I see now that Blacktop Wasteland is being billed as part Ocean's Eleven which is fair since my own mind went there (more specifically Ocean's Eight). I'm glad I didn't see the comparisons ahead of time, though, because my heist expectation would have been even higher. My mind kept expecting the plotting and the pacing of a heist novel but was being given a great crime novel that was something else altogether.Final ThoughtsIf you love a good crime story, I wholeheartedly recommend you pick up Blacktop Wasteland.

Better perhaps to treat them as an overall study in human behaviour, cultural mores, and social history and commentary. It is masterfully written from the heart, with total authority, compelling confidence and raw passion, which sets the author up as a consummate exponent in the art of storytelling and skilled in the imagery of words, affording an added dimension to the depth and range of the reading experience for me.This story was an intensely intuitive, atmospheric mix of plot and character driven elements, each fluidly fuelled by the other. As a hard-hitting, action packed, gritty thriller, with a strong narrative and dialogue, this one effortlessly hit the spot full throttle, grabbed me by the throat and never let go until the last baddie was scuppered and wasn\u2019t going to be coming back for more any time soon. A gripping story, rich in detail, of cross and double-cross, non violent crime turned into a blood bath, taking Beau along with events, as he would have me believe, against his will, but with him all too easily reverting to flashbacks of his former lifestyle, with some of the breath-taking, \u2018need for speed\u2019 car chases he took me on. This motley team of would be thieves, have convinced themselves that money will solve all their ills, magically change their lifestyles, better their life chances and buy them out of the dire situations in which they find themselves. However none of them are able to function at a basic level and realise all too late and at a terrible personal cost, that money alone can\u2019t work miracles.I became completely invested in the sprawling cast of multi-faceted, diverse and complex characters, who were easy, yet not always comfortable to connect with. Even though they were well drawn and defined, none of them were particularly engaging, as the school of life had taught them all the hard lesson of self protectionism, whilst cruel and often brutal family histories, together with harsh and destructive upbringings, had left them feeling worthless, forgotten and searching for a sense of belonging, although most would probably never have admitted it.Beau isn\u2019t a stupid person by any means, although he has convinced himself that he is a direct reflection of his fathers influence and legacy, despite his best efforts to change his ways. Even with the demon on his shoulder egging him on, I was quite surprised by the level of violence which Beau was prepared to adopt in order to protect his family, although to witness his inner turmoil, was quite heart-wrenching at times, as he was almost having to try and deny the true bond of love he felt for his father, despite knowing that he would never have been a good or stable role model and that he had been quite prepared to run out on his family and abandon them to their fate, whilst accepting that he is a product of that man and the sins of the father are often visited on the children. In Beau\u2019s own children, without imminent intervention, it is so easy to see the next generation forming in exactly the same way, so it is now up to him to turn things around, set the ground rules and sow the seeds of a better future for them as a family. He should never forget his father and the undoubted good times they shared, but he needs to shake that demon off and carve a new and different path for the Montage family.For me personally, although race and ethnicity were an obvious focus of the entire piece, they weren\u2019t the most outstanding features of the work. It was more a nuanced examination of the effects of poverty and deprivation, on a small rural community of various ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, in a landscape which time forgot, or even worse, simply chose not to remember!As well as being a first rate crime thriller of course!This is a book not to be missed and a storyline which begs being adapted as a screenplay and optioned for film.", "num_likes": 11, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4593382426", "review_id": "4593382426", "date": "Mar 11, 2022", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ineffable7980x", "user_url": "/user/show/126396804-ineffable7980x", "text": "Wow!

The tone is dark, and there is a ton of violence. No one here is an angel. They all have made bad choices, and done things they regret. Yet, this is not a novel that is despairing of humanity. Cosby's vision is not nihilistic. I would call it darkly pessimistic and cynical.At one point in the novel, one character comments to Beauregard how messed up the world is, and Beauregard says, \"The world's fine Ronnie. It's us that's f----d up\". That about sums up this novel.If you like books that are fast and smart and dark, you will love this book.

After putting it on my reading list, it eventually came up on Amazon\u2019s daily discounted and I bought. Then this month, S.A. Cosby was the prairie author interview in my \u201cMystery Scene magazine\u201d. I found it so interesting that I watched a recent interview with him on the internet. After that, I had to read this book, and after finishing it, I am so dang happy that I did. I really hesitate to say much more abut the plot beyond what is described the book cover, because I don\u2019t want to risk giving too much of the story and its many twists and turns throughout. The less the reader knows is the best approach to immersing yourself in this multi-layered story of crime, family, culture, and overcoming the past. This book is a fully immersive 305 pages, a fast thrill-ride from beginning to end. This is the story of Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage. Beauregard is many things. He is the son of a father who left him as a young boy. He is a husband of Kia, a wife he loves greatly. He is the father of two young sons, and an older daughter trying desperately to get into college. He is a business owner of his own car repair shop and an excellent mechanic. But he has a secret. A big one. He is a getaway driver. Not just any wheelman. He is the best driver there is on the entire east coast. However, Beauregard has left that life of crime behind him with the intention of settling down, becoming a family man and business owner in his small-town community. He is never going back to that prior life. That is until the economy, business competition, medical bills, and his aging mother, start to overwhelm and force him to reconsider the one option that his special talents can be used for \u2026 Let me be loud and clear. This was an amazing and mesmerizing read. It was a downright heck -of-a-suspenseful ride. Cosby pulled me in on the first page one, introducing me to a world that I honestly have never been a part of, but it captured my whole-hearted interest. I felt like I was grabbed by the throat, my participation demanded, and nothing less than my full-attention all the way through to the very last page was allowed. And let me tell you, I was a willing participant the whole way.Cosby delivered a gem on all three fronts \u2013 characters, plotting, and setting. His characters were real and multi-dimensional in ways that I have truly not experienced. They had strengths, weaknesses, and human foibles that challenged them in Shakespearian dramatic themes. Their relationships were authentic and reflected the struggles of real-life fears and challenges. Cosby\u2019s plotting was second to none. It reminded me a bit of Scott Smith\u2019s \u201cA Simple Plan\u201d with a touch of Stephen King\u2019s new novel \u201cBilly Summers\u201d. However, Cosby brought a rawness and violence that is distinctly his own. His plot twists and surprises were laid out and flowed as well as the last two minutes of the Eagles rock classic \u201cHotel California\u201d. Everything was believable and delivered by someone in command of his craft. Cosby\u2019s setting was an incredible stark and contrasting world built upon real and painful issues, including poverty, racial, and family issues. He exhibits a strong understanding of those themes and explores them brilliantly in a crime fiction framework, including the relationship of son to father, father to son, husband to wife, and friend to friend. Cosby has a unique voice and use of language. It is direct, authentic, and starkly powerful in conveying the story\u2019s themes on a personal and emotional level that requires all of the reader\u2019s senses. For me, the buzz around this book is real and well-deserved. It is a fresh, quality read. His ability to transition between the characters, plotting, and pace was smooth and natural, and he had me reflecting on my relationships with my father, my wife, and my daughters. How am I doing in relationship to Beauregard. Overall, this was a powerhouse of a read. A strong and compelling read. Definitely worthy of all the accolades it has received. Cosby has a powerful and engaging voice that is unique and insightful. A voice that is his own and a masterful storyteller in his first published novel. As soon as I finished this book, I reserved his second novel, \u201cRazorblade Tears\u201d, at my local library. But truth be told, I am not sure I can wait that long. I am already scouting it out on Amazon for reading on my Kindle.Hands down, this is a 5-star book that delivers an awesome reading experience. This would have been on my top ten lists of 2020 had I read it last year. Now it will be on my top ten list for 2021. Read it and you will know why.

Cosby is a crime thriller involving Beauregard \"Bug\" Montage. Bug is the owner of a small auto repair shop, trying to make ends meet and live what many consider a normal life when financial problems keep landing at his doorstep. In what seemed to be a past life, Bug was known to be one of the best getaway drivers in the East but has since turned from that lifestyle to raise his two boys with his wife, Kia, while operating his business. Mostly beyond Bug's control, financial difficulties continue to mount, causing Bug to reconsider his choice of the retirement of his getaway driving skills. Soon, because of limited financial paths, Bug is enticed into entering into what has been described to him as a \"sure-thing\" heist with two white trash, pecker-wood brothers. Not long after, because of his enticement and how things rarely go as planned, Bug is soon involved with two groups of even more dangerous criminals, with few places to turn. Blacktop Wasteland contains a wide range of well developed supporting characters and a tinge of generational history to Beauregard \"Bug\" Montage to add interest to his story. As the novel unfolds, Cosby creates a likable Bug as a man trying to do the right things and where readers hope for a positive outcome, while at the same time, the reader feels an impending doom is more likely. This is the first novel I have read by S.A. Cosby and it was such a pleasant surprise. The story moves along at a fast pace and like clockwork without seeming to be a cookie-cutter like assembled crime novel. While reading the novel, it was easy to picture what was being read in a cinema-like fashion. On top of that, due to the cover illustration, through the novel I kept picturing the actor Sterling K. Brown as Beauregard \"Bug\" Montage (hopefully it won't be long before a movie studio picks up the rights to this novel).It is also easy to predict, Blacktop Wasteland by S.A. Cosby will be on many top ten lists as the end of the year approaches. Blacktop Wasteland is highly recommended to fans of crime thrillers, Grit Lit/Southern Noir, and novels from authors such as George Pelecanos and Dennis LeHane.An ARC was provided by Flatiron Press/Netgalley for the promise of the return of an honest review.", "num_likes": 8, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3371071911", "review_id": "3371071911", "date": "Oct 12, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Monica **can't read fast enough**", "user_url": "/user/show/1269784-monica-can-t-read-fast-enough", "text": "This was everything that I didn't know that I was looking for and I enjoyed every page.

'Bug' managed to find a deep and lasting love with a teen sweetheart, started a family, and built a successful business that is now facing hardships because of new competition. He's managing a difficult relationship with his dying and bitter mother while trying to keep his oldest daughter from a previous relationship in his life and providing financial stability to everyone that he's responsible for.

You let them into your heart and they cased the place.\"BLACKTOP WASTELAND has been praised to the firmament and promoted to the farthest reaches of the universe, and while that's a lot for a novel to live up to, S.A. Cosby's crime novel deserves all of it and more. It not only affords a new angle on America from the 10,000-foot view as well as the 1-inch level, it is pure high-octane pleasure on every page, delivering familiar pleasures in fresh packaging. No need to unpack its smart authenticity about how the deck is stacked against blacks in America in 2020; that's been done better by better people, and the white man that I am can't come close to replicating, let alone improving, on their insights.Inside, I'll take a different tack. I usually despise tropes in crime fiction, as they're often used in the service of paint-by-numbers plotting and cardboard characterizations to create a sense of commercially palatable comfort that's calculated to move units. But BLACKTOP WASTELAND is a different beast \u2014 it leans into its tropes with such sincerity and weight that they become features, not bugs. To be more specific:\u2014 The Heist. There's not a lot here you couldn't find in, say, CHARLEY VARRICK. There's a team, and the team has a leader, a weak soldier, a more-clever-than-smart lieutenant that's holding back something unsettling about their motive, the girlfriend who can't be completely trusted, etc. Something always goes wrong; somebody always gets killed.\u2014 One Last Job. The hero knows it's stupid to get pulled back into the life he's been trying to leave behind. But he needs the money, he feels forced into it by scary people, and whether or not he can admit it, he's addicted to the thrill of the planning and execution.\u2014 Daddy Issues. The hero feels he has to live up to what his daddy is, or what his daddy expects of him, or what his daddy has decided he isn't capable of. He knows it's emotional stupid, but he's in the grip of it nonetheless.\u2014 The Yappy Wife/Girlfriend. The women in male-centric crime novels are always on the sidelines, always nagging their man to do the safe but boring thing, always pummeling them with rage and tears, always threatening to leave and take the kids. They're always right, too. Except for ....\u2014 A Man's Gotta Do What A Man's Gotta Do. Yes, he should walk away. But he can't. Not when he's gotta provide. Not when his manhood is being challenged or taunted. Not when his Daddy Issues dominate him. Not when he has to do One Last Job because His Past WillNever Leave Him Be. But most of all, because he needs to feel like a Man.Alone, these tropes are usually annoying. Together, they're all but unbearable, because usually the author doesn't unpack them \u2014 they just drop them flat on the page with little explanation in the expectation that the reader will find them instantly sympathetic and thus sublime company from page to page. These are almost everywhere in the contemporary suspense/thriller moment: My Sister Was Murdered Twenty Years Ago; My High School Secret Won't Stay Buried; My New Husband and Wife Is Keeping Something From Me; I've Been Cheated Upon and Need to Start Over in My Small Hometown; Why Is the Sexy New Au Pair Looking at Me With That Sly Insinuating Smile, etc.But S.A. Cosby doubles down them these tropes with such utter pain and sincerity that they become utterly necessary and plausible. The circumstances that lead Beauregard \"Bug\" Montage to decide the financial gain from a jewelry-store holdup are laid out in patient detail that should resonate with anyone struggling to keep a family maintained or a business afloat. The circumstances are so pressing and the payoff so enticing that they not only lead Beauregard to look past the loose ends of the One Last Job that threaten to pull apart the fabric of the heist plan, but the loose characters on which he has to depend. We don't learn about these unreliables in passing; we get to see the irratuonal justifications of the unreliables in their own voices.The Daddy Issues seem decorative until they are unpacked in a flashback scene that shows, completely convincingly, how Beauregard's formative years were torn apart by the need to live up to his Daddy's reputation and the knowledge that any credible future he has depends on shedding his patriarchal skin and going straight. You can't read that scene and not understand the good and bad angels sitting on Beauregard's shoulders and shouting into his ears every waking second of every day.And The Yappy Wife/Girlfriend trope is redeemed in the final pages: when he most needs to firmly grasp the wheel of his future and decide whether to turn one direction or the other, Beauregard stops shining on his wife and pretending to pay attention to her, and for once actually listens, and finds defining wisdom in her words. It was a brave choice that redeemed the Man's Gotta Do trope.Much of what is being said about BLACKTOP WASTELAND will, justifiably, focus on its window into Black America, its canny empathy with economic inequality, its spotlight on systemic unfairness. But I hope some see the novel for the superiority of its craft and the sincerity with which it's practiced. These things are what gives this wonderful novel the emotional burst that engages with the story like a supercharger engages with a car at high speed. BLACKTOP WASTELAND not only fires cleanly on all cylinders, it boils the road of its genre and leaves most other crime novels still trying to get off the starting line.", "num_likes": 7, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3535782970", "review_id": "3535782970", "date": "Feb 22, 2022", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Amos", "user_url": "/user/show/15237-amos", "text": "Once this story kicks into gear you just gotta hold on tight!!

There was so much substance and real life issues sprinkled throughout this novel that can be easily missed due to the action or taken at face value. The constant theme in the novel is the systemic issue of poverty and demographics. It shows how poverty and bad luck can follow you throughout a family and generation. It shows the rat race that one can get into when poor and how hard it is to climb out of a hole and live.

I\u2019ve always loved the thrill of controlling a vehicle to hug the blacktop and negotiate the turns at the fastest speed possible. Alas, those days are long gone. But I digress...Ronnie was screaming in his ear. No words, just one long nonsensical wail. They were doing 60, hurtling towards an unfinished section of road.Backwards.This book concerns a family man, Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage, whose car repair shop is losing business to the fancier new shop that has come to his very small town in Virginia. His mom is in a senior assisted living center and his daughter needs money for college. His salvage yard-owning mentor, Boonie, has no money to lend him. He can think of no other way to get an infusion of money than to yet again be the getaway driver for a heist. Things go terribly wrong. The rest of the book is Bug dealing with the aftermath of the heist. There are several evil characters that we don\u2019t get to know intimately but Bug and his close friends and family are fairly well characterized. Mrs. Talbot didn\u2019t like his mother and Beauregard couldn\u2019t really say he blamed her. At the same time, it was no need to make it sound like his mother was a thief. Cruel, insensitive, manipulative, yes. Thief, no. The Montage men held down the thievery crown in his family.Bug doesn\u2019t want to end up like his father, who was also a criminal and left his family high and dry when Bug was young. His wife, Kia, wants Bug to stay out of the Life permanently. He likes the excitement of fast driving and has no compunction from using violence on those who have done him wrong. Isn\u2019t he already like his father?Bug wrestles with leaving his family so they won\u2019t endure repercussions from his recent criminal activity. He knows the effect his father leaving had on him as a son. Why doesn\u2019t he realize they will still endure hostility if he flees? What about his oldest boy? He\u2019s already broken the law and he\u2019s still a kid. Doesn\u2019t he need a father? Doesn\u2019t his wife deserve a partner?

The story involves Beauregard or \"Bug\", a black mechanic living in small-town Virginia (this leads to some interesting interactions as to be expected), scraping by as a small-business owner of a mechanics garage -- he has a second wife with two kids, another kid from a previous relationship when dumb and young, a waspy mother, and father who exited his life as a young kid. Life seemed to be going swimmingly until his past as a criminal comes rearing its ugly head, flipping his life upside down and putting a ton of stress on the fella. Cosby has a knack for cutting prose and pitch-perfect dialog, capturing the feel of the southern states and criminal element. He also excels at an interesting plot without losing plenty of feeling. Bug is a complicated character to be sure, both with a complicated relationship with his father (idolizing him in some ways but cursed by him in others). Action is also well-wrought with tons of high speed chases, heists, and gun-play. There's hardly anything to knock on this one, and while not life-changing, it is extremely entertaining and surprisingly heart-felt. At the end of this one I'm still unsure what to think of Bug.

The narrative voice meanders and loses the sweaty immediacy of the first chapter. Sentence structure and rhythm becomes distractingly atonal. Cosby bludgeons the reader with strained simile.

Some set pieces, particularly a couple action scenes, come together nicely. The plot is well-constructed and the right beats happen at the right times. There are moments of razor-sharp, incisive dialogue. But even that is inconsistent, and Cosby frequently succumbs to cliche. The characters are completely two-dimensional and rote, pastiches of Elmore Leonard or George Pelecanos creations rather than believable people. There's no distinction between the narrative voices of major characters. Similes and thoughts are laughably out of place - far too verbose and sophisticated for sorry rednecks, for example.

It certainly isn't something that I would normally have picked to read, but I am trying to diversify my reading this year, so maybe that's why I included it. It seems to have been written for men who like fast, loud cars, and who really get off on driving them. It is basically a heist story and the main protagonist is a getaway driver extraordinaire. Nobody can catch him when he's behind the wheel.That protagonist is a Black man called Beauregard \"Bug\" Montage. He has a checkered past, but now he's attempting to go straight. He has his own garage. He is a family man who is trying to take care of that family and set a good example for his two children. But he has money troubles and one of his former associates takes advantage of that. He offers him a chance to make one big payday. All he has to do is drive a getaway car once again. The job is a sure-thing jewelry store heist that promises a big payoff for everybody involved. Bug's back is against the wall and he feels he has no choice but to go for it. After all, nothing could possibly go wrong. Until, of course, something does.Bug has a car that belonged to his father, a man who disappeared from his life when he needed him most, and whose ghost still haunts him as an adult. The car is a Duster. (I looked it up - it's an old model of Plymouth from the '70s.) Bug loves that car more than life itself. It's a juiced-up model that he has tricked out as a drag racer. When he runs in drag races he always wins. No one can touch that car. It would probably be worth $25,000 and his wife begs him to sell it in order to wipe out his debt, but Bug refuses. He'll take the job as a getaway driver instead.The jewelry store heist turns out to be a bit more complicated than advertised. The jewels actually belong to a really bad guy and he takes offense at having his property stolen. Revenge is on his mind and Bug's family is in the frame as one of his targets. The whole thing gets really tangled and Bug has to agree to do another job to get himself and his family clear. The results could easily have been predicted by anyone who was paying attention.There are some nice moments in the book. The core of the story is about father-son relationships, race, class, family, and identity. Some of this might have been developed for deeper exploration had this been a different kind of book, but the writer obviously had other goals in mind. His goal seems to have been to write a hard-driving, testosterone saturated gritty crime thriller, and, to some extent, I suppose he succeeded in that. Obviously, I was not the audience he had in mind for his book, but I expect the target audience loved it.

But this is no Ocean's Eleven. It seems everything that could go wrong, does, and the bulk of the story is on everything that followed that crime.While Bug makes a lot of bad decisions, he is clearly the only one with brains in the trio, and it is also clear, the other two men are the reason why everything continues to go south.\"The world's fine, Ronnie.

It just shouldn't. I must have encountered at least 5 or 6 overly used and abused tropes within the first few chapters that had me worried they would surely cause the demise of this book. I have never been more relieved to be proved wrong. S.A. Cosby has created a masterpiece with his gritty, intense crime fiction novel Blacktop Wasteland. Cosby took every single tired trope, cut them up into pieces, threw them up in the air only to intricately weave them back together but into something fresh and unique. On top of feeling like this story was a unicorn, I literally could not put it down. Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage is a character that I will not soon forget and just might be one of my top 10 favorites. I've always had a soft spot for tortured heroes and I found myself in several shades of emotions throughout the book. There were moments I rooted for him. Moments my eyes got blurry with tears. My heart hurt for the child inside the man that just wanted to be enough for his daddy. My heart ached for the husband and father who tried to live on the right side of the law but continually got the shitty end of the stick. Moments of despair when I thought maybe, just maybe there was no coming back after fully embracing all that darkness.Blacktop Wasteland is the full package--from the clear voices of the dialogue, to the relatable characters (Kia, Kelvin, Boonie) the exhilarating and nail-biting heist to quieter moments in the novel, flashbacks that are perfectly placed and eventually lead up to one of the most pivotal moments in Beauregard's life. Add to the fact that this book read like a movie. From the very opening scene to the very last page, I could visualize the entire cinematic experience in my mind. Idris Elba or Mahershala Ali as Beauregard. Directed by Jeff Nichols. Well written, intense, storytelling at its best, Blacktop Wasteland is the onion of all onions-- so many layers that can appeal to so many different types of readers.

How rare is it for a story like that to live up to the hype? But that\u2019s exactly what Cosby\u2019s book does.If one were forced to pigeonhole the book, you might say it\u2019s a heist novel, but it goes far deeper than that. Characterization is at the forefront for Cosby, and the book centers around one of the most complex characters you\u2019ll find in the crime genre. Beauregard \u201cBug\u201d Montage is kind of a badass, but where some authors quell the character development there, Cosby digs quite a bit deeper. Bug leads a dual-life, a man of violence, or maybe more aptly a man of doing what needs to be done to get by. He\u2019s also a family, demonstrating from the first appearance of Kia and his children, his devotion and willingness to take care of them at the cost of everything else.You take the action, the fight scenes, the pulse-pounding driving scenes, and the tension out of this story and you still have the story of a flawed character doing the best he can with the cards life has dealt. But why on earth would want to take those other things away when they\u2019re so well done? The driving scenes are written with a cinematic flare and genuine thrill. Just try reading them from anywhere but the edge of your seat.The setting is a massive contributor to the overall feel of the story. So many plot points stem from money issues, which stem from the difficulties of being a black-owned mechanic in a town where the cookie-cutter assembly line type of mechanic shop opens up. Seeking opportunities to better your situation, but society seems to be doing everything in its power to hold you down. I\u2019ve already written at length about Bug\u2019s character development, but this picture of rural black America lends a great deal of credibility and authenticity to Cosby\u2019s portrayal.Blacktop Wasteland is equal parts compelling, thrilling, and surprising.

He runs an auto-mechanic shop, but thanks to Precision, they're taking all his business. The crickets are busier in \"Bug's\" shop than he and his cousin, Kelvin are. Bug has been in trouble in the past. His daddy disappeared on them when he was a kid, and he has, rightly or wrongly, put the man on a pedestal even while he mostly brought them trouble. Bug is sure he's cut out to be just like his father. Bad = Bug. And so far, he's trying to balance his two selves. The bad Bug, the good Bug. But. Debts. On top of everything, his auto-mechanic's shop rent is due - past due actually, and his mama's assisted living is about to boot her out due to a snafu in Medicare.Yeah boy. Problems. So an opportunity comes by way of somebody he ought to know better than to trust. Good ole Ronnie and Reggie Sessions, two a**backwards thinking winners, I mean losers. But, Bug needs to do something. Off they go. They're in the money! It gets sprinkled where it needs to and puts out the immediate fires. Only, then it goes bad. Then it gets worse. Then it gets EVEN worse. And you wonder how in the world can any one man stand it? You will have to read to figure out all that happens. I wish there was a way to hook up a reader to a device to measure heart rate and blood pressure while reading such novels as this.

My recurring thought was that this author must have recently completed a high school English course and was applying what they discussed in class that day.It felt as if the author struggled with how to share details with the reader. Objects and events were described three times over in a variety of ways when one would have sufficed. Attention to detail is great, but saturating the text with pinpoint focus overwhelms the reader and completely destroys the momentum. Thugs arrive with guns akimbo? Time to take two minutes describing their outfits. Climactic car chase that could change the course of the main character's life? Let's spend a paragraph reviewing their stick shift maneuvers.The use of constant and overextended metaphors/similes also consistently pulled the reader out of the story. Had they been interspersed over the course of several pages I would have valued their impact more. However, it was rare to find a page that didn't have at least two uses of figurative language that didn't quite hit the mark.The author employed a strange use of perspective, causing the reader to struggle with the narration changing between first and third person. I was frequently re-listening to blocks of passages attempting to determine whose thoughts were being shared. Often, what could have passed as beautiful internal self-talk became forced and pompous self-revelations laboriously spelled out to another character.Finally, I felt that the character of Bug was played up to be almost omnipotent. The speed at which he constructs flawless and perfectly timed criminal plans was meant to demonstrate that he was \"part of the life\", but really it just came off as sloppy characterization. Not to mention that Bug has the incredible ability to self-heal, because none of his numerous injuries (which are vividly described then promptly forgotten) impact his performance.Coupled with wholly one-dimensional side characters and an unsatisfying ending, I walked away from this book with bad taste in my mouth.", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["reviewed"]}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3276234605", "review_id": "3276234605", "date": "Apr 12, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Suzanne Crain Miller", "user_url": "/user/show/104284043-suzanne-crain-miller", "text": "As a big fan/connoisseur of crime fiction, Blacktop Wasteland, by S.A. Cosby, did not let me down. Indeed, it set the bar higher for any writer tackling Southern Noir. Readers are taken on a hell of a ride with racer/former get away driver, Beauregard, who finds himself torn between who he was, where he comes from and who he wants to be all while navigating horrendous potholes that have become his life on the backroads in small towns of Virginia. The journey that author S.A.Cosby takes us on is much like a race itself, beginning at a speed that gives us time to fully invest in Beauregard's life and the myriad of other characters who play second fiddle to this larger than life protagonist. By the middle of the book, much like when racers are part way through their turn on a drag strip, the story cranks up to a full throttle pace and doesn't let up until the unprecedentedly epic ending.  Many authors in the noir genre make the mistake of too much action and not enough character development. This is not Cosby. He makes no mistakes and shows off his skills in his ability to do both equally well with sections of stunning prose intermingled with savage grit. He's a masterful craftsman with the way he makes the reader pause for reflection with impressive one liners, greatly adding to the reading experience. One of my favorites was \"Terror had a way of making smart men stupid\". Through Beauregard's character, Cosby shows us not only what it must be like to be a man with a past they can't quite get out from under, but also sheds a much needed light on what it's like to be a black man in America. There are few writers who could do this with the challenging, yet straightforward way Cosby has. Blacktop Wasteland is a book that many will be talking about for years to come. I feel sure it will serve as a modern classic and my only disappointing moment while reading it came when I realized I was on the last page.

Clean prose, sharp dialogue, an unexpected setting (rural Virginia), and some serious novelistic craft on display throughout. If the narrative bones are familiar--hard times demand hard crimes, and everything that can go wrong must go wrong--focusing on a getaway driver trying to juggle his natural calling with middle-aged responsibilities works surprisingly well. It's a bit less of the moody, existential noir that I was hoping for--I'm a defective reader in that this is the only kind of crime fiction I gravitate towards--but instead it's an excellent heist thriller with a healthy dose of realism, sharply drawn characters, and a backdrop that feels surprisingly relevant and new. Rather excellent for what it is.EDIT: I realize I didn't mention the obvious fact that this is also a novel about race, to the extent it's foregrounded by the experience of being black in rural America. While not the overall focus, there is a persistent thread of the type of casual, every-day racist bullshit from some of the white characters. And the forces driving the protagonist's \"hard times\" clearly boil down to structural racism, wealth inequality, and everything else that's top of mind in the current national discourse. But as much as this is a novel set against that reality, it's not focused on social justice. The focus is on individual characters, crime, family, the impact of hard choices against a backdrop of very human struggles. All of it is informed and given added weight by the carefully-wrought context, and I think anyone reading this in 2020 will bring some of the current moment to the experience of the novel, but the book itself trains its narrative eye on something slightly different, and it feels more personal as a result.", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_id": "60502128-maldito-asfalto", "book_title": "Maldito asfalto", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3522739715", "review_id": "3522739715", "date": "Sep 02, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Sonica", "user_url": "/user/show/69753119-sonica", "text": "Thank you Flatiron Books for my copy of Blacktop Wasteland by S.A.

When a job comes along that could solve his money problems, Bug is pulled back into his old career one last time. I loved Blacktop Wasteland. This was a fast paced, gritty, and fun, novel that covered just about anything I could want from it. It manages to balance out Bug as this fantastically capable getaway driver grappling with being a good father and good family man, dealing with family history and historical problems arising from him being Black. It\u2019s fun because of the scenes too, some of the driving scenes are wild, and the writing is just so good it feels like you\u2019re watching them. I adored the characters in this.

All of the characters feel like fully fleshed out people, that you know, that you could one day know, and even those you really don\u2019t want to know. Plus, I have to give a nod to the names - Bug and Ant? Perfect nicknames. There are definitely some hard to read parts too though, it\u2019s a violent story at times.

Beauregard, a reformed criminal driver, who now runs a mechanic shop is really down on his luck after having several pretty good, above-board years. Cosby tackles the tricky subjects of the poverty cycle effect and racism in the South by showing us exactly how Beauregard wants to be a better man, provide for his family in a legitimate way and be able to raise his kids to overcome the criminal life he thought he had put behind him. Family patterns are impactful, though. The specter of his criminal father, long gone, still has a pull on Beauregard Montage. It seems his world is about to fall down with a daughter who has to postpone college due to lack of funds, a mother about to be released from her assisted living facility due to lack of funds, his garage payments due and his work struggling due to the opening of franchised garage across the street from his garage, his son needs braces.....and the list goes on. \"Bug\" has a choice. He can sell his beloved car that once belonged to his father, or he can do just one last criminal job with a redneck criminal Ronnie \"Rock & Roll\" Sessions. What can go wrong....? Well, everything!!The Audible narrator, Adam Lazarre-White is SO VERY GOOD! I highly recommend listening. **Be forewarned, though. The violence is heavy and intense.

Yes! Still an existentialist romantic, but \u201eAn\u00e9antir\u201c is a political thriller, a roman \u00e0 clef, a family novel and a love story that makes references to all of the great master\u2019s fictional work \u2013 and in the end, the author, 65 years old, hints at quitting his profession, after only eight novels. Non, Michel, ne quitte pas!!\u201eAn\u00e9antir\u201c is set in 2027, Emmanuel Macron is approaching the end of his second five-year term. Our protagonist Paul Raison is the personal adviser to the Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Juge (Houellebecq is a good friend of the real minister, Bruno Le Maire, who, before the book\u2019s publication, helped spark rumors about the content). While seeking a new Presidential candidate and preparing for the election, international terror attacks shake France and other nations. Who are the terrorists, and what are their aims? The secret service investigates.This plotline becomes less and less important as the story progresses though. Paul\u2019s marriage to Prudence (yup, a Beatles reference!) is in decline, but, in what in the context of Houellebecq can only be read as a surprising plot twist, the two try to revive it in the face of tragedy: Paul\u2019s father, a former secret service agent, suffered a stroke. His partner, a simple, but dedicated and loving woman named Madeleine, cares for him, the family fights again a n anonymous, commercialized health care system. Paul\u2019s unhappily married younger brother Aur\u00e9lien falls in love with a nurse from Mali, his older, deeply religious sister C\u00e9cile tries to stand by her unemployed husband, a notary with connections to right-wing Catholic circles. This family story about, believe it or not, the power and tragedy of love, is the heart of the novel. From there, he investigates a plethora of themes, from tech to terrrorism, from sex to spirituality, from politics to literature. Houellebecq completists (like me) will find references to all of his novels in this book. I was particularly impressed by the way he incorporates Philippe Lan\u00e7on's Le Lambeau into his book, a book about the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, probably the most traumatic experience in Houellebecq\u2019s life. His sparse, sober style works well with this story, focusing on the intricate plot and, per usual, refraining from a lyrical language: Houellebecq stays true to his matter-fact-tone. The story culimates in personal sadness and the possibility of happiness, both at the same time, while the political threat rages on. It will be interesting how the book will be discussed in the context of the upcoming French election, and it will be great fun to search for and investigate the connection to the other seven novels. Published in a lux edition in France, because \u201cLe livre, c\u2019est un de mes objets pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la vie\u201d (same, Michel, saaame!) \u2013 the design makes a reference to the Beatles\u2018 \u201eWhite Album\u201c, which also plays a role in the novel.

parte mia, ma soprattutto a distorsioni volontarie della realt\u00e0. Dopotutto questo \u00e8 un romanzo, la realt\u00e0 \u00e8 solo un materiale di partenzaParto dalla nota finale presente nei ringraziamenti perch\u00e9 mi ricorda qualcosa di simile scritto da Mar\u00edas, sul fatto che i romanzi aiuterebbero ad esplorare le possibilit\u00e0 di vita che non si sono concretizzate, ci\u00f2 che avrebbe potuto essere, secondo lo spagnolo, \u00e8 importante quasi quanto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato.Sempre nei ringraziamenti \u00e8 presente un altro punto cruciale:Se scrivo che Astrid Nielsen si prende cura di suo marito con coraggio, non sar\u00e0 contenta; quindi non lo scriver\u00f2, ma ne approfitto per dirle un\u2019altra cosa, che non ho osato dirle a voce: \u00e8 stato mentre tornavo di notte alla stazione di Thionville, dopo la giornata trascorsa a casa sua, che ho sentito per la prima volta che, qualunque cosa accadesse, dovevo portare a termine questo libroQuale libro? Quello che finisce con la sezione 5 o quello che inizia con la sezione 6? C\u2019\u00e8 un disegno enigmatico a carboncino che precede la sezione, pare raffigurare una coda. La coda di questo romanzo, per quanto triste \u00e8 la sua parte migliore, ci consegna un Houellebecq diverso dal solito, meno amaro, meno cinico, per quanto sempre lucido. Se avete cinquant\u2019anni la possibilit\u00e0 che esplora vi sembrer\u00e0 tutt\u2019altro che remota, \u00e8 probabile che vi rivediate a leggere un referto in una mattinata soleggiata o in una serata umida. Le parole sono importanti, anche quelle nebulose del linguaggio medico, codificate in un modo che disorienta il paziente di per s\u00e9 intimorito.Quella che a me \u00e8 sembrata una coda \u00e8 comunque ben saldata al corpo della narrazione, ancora una volta (marchio di fabbrica di Houellebecq) posticipata di qualche anno rispetto al presente. I fatti si svolgono fra la fine dell\u2019anno 2026 e l\u2019inizio del 2027, con la Francia in campagna elettorale per le presidenziali. Houellebecq \u00e8 sempre prodigo di riferimenti alla cultura francese, quando invece che storici sono di cronaca, si fa un po\u2019 pi\u00f9 di fatica a seguirli, si pu\u00f2 trovare per esempio l\u2019accenno ad un ignoto conduttore tv, o ad un giornale indipendente. La Francia per\u00f2 \u00e8 membro a pieno titolo del blocco occidentale di cui anche il nostro paese fa parte, dunque le disquisizioni sul capitalismo, l\u2019immigrazione, il terrorismo non risentono della francesit\u00e0 e si fanno leggere con interesse. In questo romanzo Houellebecq interseca alle vicende di Paul Raison e della sua famiglia a quelle di un disegno terroristico che vorrebbe annientare il mondo tecnologico in cui stiamo vivendo, servendosi proprio della tecnologia. Sono presenti i canoni del thriller, quelli della spy story, vi sono inserti filosofici, letterari psicanalitici (i sogni di Paul Raison, mai banali, assurdi in modo controllato, indirizzato, sono la cosa che mi \u00e8 piaciuta meno del libro). \u00c8 un\u2019opera ambiziosa e ben scritta, che con le sue 550 pagine supera il cabotaggio medio delle opere di Houellebecq (attestato intorno alle 250) senza mai far pensare che una sforbiciata sarebbe stata proficua. Dubito che il 2022 letterario ci offrir\u00e0 un romanzo migliore di questo, io per\u00f2 avevo gi\u00e0 apprezzato L\u2019estensione, Serotonina, Sottomissione e Piattaforma, dovete chiedere anche a qualcuno meno schierato.Ho trovato interessante questo articolo in merito ad una frase che anch\u2019io avevo faticato ad interpretare [l\u2019articolo contiene SPOILER]https://www.totalitarismo.blog/michel...

E confesso che la cosa mi ha sorpreso e un po' spaventato. Bisogner\u00e0 che me lo rumini bene.

Poi, come tutti i romanzi scritti bene, crea un ambiente, un mondo, con i suoi umori, sentimenti, colori.A tratti andando avanti nelle pagine e in quelle atmosfere ovattate, tra ospedali, RSA, case grandi e silenziose, boschi autunnali e lungofiumi nebbiosi ci si sporge pericolosamente verso un accenno di noia, di quasi assopimento. Il pilota automatico si affaccia a proporsi: \u201cvado avanti io?\u201d. La lunghezza del libro e la mancanza di certi eccessi di furori acidi e scorrettissimi, a cui Hb ci aveva abituati, accentua la percezione di un calo di tensione. Ma dura poco. I capitoli brevi, gli incastri degli diversi scenari e una frasetta giusta che improvvisamente illumina tutto un panorama mentale, rompono la monotonia. Al pilota si risponde \u201clascia stare, che questa \u00e8 roba che mi riguarda\u201d. E cos\u00ec si torna alla tensione di lettura giusta. Forse proprio in quel vago senso di noia morbidosa (e nel primo sogno nella casa del padre), sta nascosto il segreto di questo romanzo.Tirando le somme.

Annientare, il suo nono romanzo, sar\u00e0 pubblicato il 7 gennaio da La Nave di Teseo (tr. Milena Zemira Ciccimarra), in contemporanea con l\u2019uscita sugli scaffali francesi. Diciamolo subito e senza indugi: Annientare \u00e8 un grande libro, in cui lo scrittore francese 65enne - l\u2019autore di Piattaforma (2001), Sottomissione (2015) e Serotonina (2019) - si conferma una delle voci pi\u00f9 importanti sulla scena narrativa internazionale, capace di cogliere le istanze nichiliste che devastano la societ\u00e0 e la crisi della civilt\u00e0 liberale che si frantuma contro i dogmi religiosi dei fanatismi. Annientamento \u00e8 la parola d\u2019ordine del futuro cui stiamo andando incontro e Houellebecq, coerente al proprio pensiero, lo conferma sin dal suo esordio nel 1994, con Estensione del dominio della lotta. Nel nuovo romanzo la scena si apre in Francia, negli ultimi giorni del 2026. La nazione transalpina sta vivendo un prepotente riscatto economico che le permette di sopravanzare la Germania nel mercato automobilistico, sfidando apertamente la Cina nell\u2019approvvigionamento delle materie prime, grazie all\u2019impeto di Bruno Juge, il Ministro dell\u2019Economia. Al suo fianco, ecco il protagonista assoluto, Paul Raison, stretto collaboratore, confidente di Juge che affiancher\u00e0 nella sua corsa alle presidenziali francesi del 2027 (in ticket con un presentatore tv, un burattino ammaliato dal prestigio) rendendo l\u2019Eliseo, il potere politico e la sua percezione sociale ai giorni nostri, come uno dei perni del romanzo.Oscillando fra pubblico e privato, scopriamo presto che Paul, in crisi con sua moglie Prudence (immaginata nella copertina, \u00abcome fonte di luce e resistenza\u00bb nelle parole della Sgarbi), correr\u00e0 al capezzale del padre, colpito da una ischemia cerebrale; ci\u00f2 ricongiunger\u00e0 i tre figli aprendo degli spaccati sulle loro esistenze, dalla grande fede di C\u00e9cile alla mesta vita del terzogenito, Aur\u00e9lien, impelagato in un burrascoso matrimonio. Ma l\u2019attualit\u00e0 politica \u00e8 un filo conduttore e alzando lo sguardo dalle quotidiane battaglie dei suoi personaggi, Houellebecq segue le vicende di una minaccia hacker globale, una forza entropica che potrebbe sconvolgere le basi della societ\u00e0 civile, con un susseguirsi di attentati a navi portacontainer e banche di liquido seminale, accompagnati da video-messaggi in cui ricorrono pentacoli, richiami al Diavolo e alla magia nera, sconcertando le forze di pubblica sicurezza per l\u2019assenza di rivendicazioni.Non fatevi spaventare dalle 746 pagine, Annientare ha un narratore in terza e una prosa sempre fluida anche capace di far sorridere, alternando lo scenario internazionale con un ristretto nucleo di personaggi, mescolando lutto e desiderio, ambizione e innamoramento, mostrando l\u2019incapacit\u00e0 della razza umana di comunicare, una sorta di inadeguatezza alla felicit\u00e0 che conduce verso il suo annichilimento. Ci\u00f2 diventa evidente quando l\u2019autore narra il destino degli anziani nelle Rsa, preda del lucido razionalismo del sistema sanitario, sfociando nella sorte di Paul, con una forte svolta intimista nel suo sguardo che azzera la distanza dalla pagina.Annientare \u00e8 un romanzo duro e cupo eppure colmo di bellezza, tramite il quale il suo autore conferma il proprio estro, sempre capace di infilare considerazioni nichiliste sul senso della vita, incastonando pensieri misantrope e misogini con una naturalezza unica, senza giri di parole, senza sensi di colpa, senza farla tanto lunga, insomma. Ci\u00f2 dona al lettore una chiarezza attesa, una voce chiara da seguire dalla prima all\u2019ultima pagina. Ammettiamolo, sembra dire l\u2019autore, pensiamo alla morte e al sesso nel corso delle giornate e riuscire a far coesistere la complessit\u00e0 umana sulla pagina, i pensieri nobili e quelli gretti, \u00e8 una dimostrazione di stile.Houellebecq osa e sfida i nostri tab\u00f9 - sessuali e religiosi - riuscendo a cogliere le istanze in arrivo. Non a caso \u00e8 considerato uno scrittore profetico: \u00e8 accaduto con Sottomissione, intuendo l\u2019islamizzazione della Francia mentre in Serotonina narrava l\u2019avvento dei gilet gialli e d\u2019una protesta dal basso e violenta. Accade anche in Annientare: gli attentati internazionali e gli hacker scuotono la Francia, \u00abla democrazia \u00e8 morta come sistema, troppo lenta, troppo pesante\u00bb, ormai svuotata di significato, ferita a morte dallo svilimento dell'informazione a vantaggio dei social media. Accadr\u00e0? Houellebecq ci invita ad aprire gli occhi: sta gi\u00e0 accadendo e non solo in Francia.Profetico o meno, lo scrittore francese che riempie i teatri con le sue poesie, omaggia Lovecraft e rilegge la Commedia di Balzac, inevitabilmente ci costringe a notare che in Italia non mancano certo le voci di talento, semmai, sembriamo aver smarrito l'ambizione di voler scrivere un romanzo internazionale, una storia che sfidi il mercato e vada oltre la commedia, i commissari di quartiere e i consueti schemi da dramma familiare che rassicurano ma annoiano perch\u00e9 zeppi di clich\u00e9. Nessuno come Houellebecq \u00e8 capace di titillare le nostre paure, facendosi e si fa beffe di chi, un libro dopo l\u2019altro, lo accusa inutilmente di machismo. Pur se avulso dal circo dei social \u00e8 sempre capace di polarizzare l'attenzione mondiale dei media, basti ricordare che Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re lo omaggia apertamente. Houellebecq dimostra che un vero scrittore deve \u201csemplicemente\" scrivere. Senza paura, illuminando la tenebra che ci circonda. Il resto, \u00e8 rumore di fondo.

Comme c'est le cas depuis la sortie en 2005 de La Possibilit\u00e9 d'une \u00eele, chacun de ses livres est scrut\u00e9 par la presse et la critique, \u00e9clipsant plusieurs autres magnifiques romans qui, comme c'est le cas cette ann\u00e9e, figurent dans la rentr\u00e9e litt\u00e9raire.An\u00e9antir est son huiti\u00e8me roman et je dois dire que, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, j'ai l'impression que le ton de sa prose a chang\u00e9, il est devenu plus doux, moins percutant peut-\u00eatre, ce qui est sans doute un des sympt\u00f4mes ind\u00e9niables de la vieillesse. De plus, les personnages f\u00e9minins apparaissent plus lumineux et humains, loin de l'utilitarisme sexuel auquel ils \u00e9taient soumis dans ses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents romans. Avec plus de sept cents pages, la lecture est n\u00e9anmoins fluide, car l'histoire est toujours int\u00e9ressante. Non, ce n'est pas le meilleur Houellebecq que j'ai lu, mais c'est certainement (avec La carte et le territoire) celui qui se d\u00e9marque le plus du reste de son \u0153uvre. Nous sommes en 2027, ann\u00e9e \u00e9lectorale, et l'histoire se concentre sur Paul Raison, un fonctionnaire du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9conomie et des finances, qui est presque le bras droit du ministre lui-m\u00eame, Bruno Juge, un personnage tr\u00e8s proche du pouvoir. Dans ce contexte, il est facile d'\u00eatre d'accord avec ceux qui disent que c'est son roman le plus politique. Mais le regard approfondi de l'auteur ne se concentre pas seulement sur la p\u00e9riode \u00e9lectorale, mais aussi sur la vie familiale de Raison, les relations avec sa femme Prudence, sa s\u0153ur C\u00e9cile et son fr\u00e8re Aur\u00e9lien. Lorsque son p\u00e8re \u00c9douard tombe dans le coma, cela d\u00e9clenche une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9pisodes qui vont le marquer profond\u00e9ment. Dans un projet de cette envergure, il est presque in\u00e9vitable que l'auteur ne se r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas. Certaines sections souffrent d'un exc\u00e8s de mots qui affectent manifestement la lecture. Par exemple, il y a une abondance de descriptions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es des r\u00eaves de Raison qui sont redondantes et ennuyeuses. Mais cela n'emp\u00eache pas le message d'\u00eatre transmis. \u00c0 mon avis, la meilleure partie du roman est constitu\u00e9e par les deux cents derni\u00e8res pages, dans lesquelles Houellebecq se concentre sur le th\u00e8me de la mort et qui, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, refl\u00e8tent les sentiments de l'auteur, n\u00e9 en 1956.Dans cette derni\u00e8re partie, son \u00e9criture s'enveloppe d'un lyrisme vraiment surprenant (peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 cause de la dose d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 qui \u00e9mane du discours), bien loin du cynisme auquel il nous a habitu\u00e9s auparavant. D'ailleurs, tout au long du roman, les longues phrases servent de support formel, un peu comme les colonnes en architecture. L\u00e0, l'air semble s'arr\u00eater, et pourtant quelque chose dans l'\u00e9criture, une propulsion qui vient de l'int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame de la phrase, parvient \u00e0 soutenir le souffle et \u00e0 poursuivre jusqu'\u00e0 sa merveilleuse r\u00e9solution. Dans ces moments, notre regard quitte les lettres imprim\u00e9es sur la page et se perd dans l'horizon lointain, dans un voyage n\u00e9cessaire, pour trouver le sens de la vie.", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4448019430", "review_id": "4448019430", "date": "Jan 22, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Santiago", "user_url": "/user/show/109170175-santiago", "text": "Houellebecq \u00fcberrascht. Von ihm sind wir M\u00e4nner in mittleren Jahren gew\u00f6hnt, ohne greifbare Vergangenheit m\u00fcssen sie feststellen, dass sie auch keine Zukunft erwartet, bis auf seltene Momente immer unverdienten Gl\u00fccks hat ihnen das Leben nichts zu bieten: ihnen bleibt einzig die Resignation. Doch zu diesem Ergebnis gelangen seine Protagonisten sonst erst gegen Ende - hier steht der resignierte Paul am Anfang des Romans. Seine Ehe ist zerr\u00fcttet, der Kontakt zu seiner Familie nur sp\u00e4rlich. Das einzige was ihn durch die Tage zu tragen scheint ist sein Alltag, der Job als Vertrauter des franz\u00f6sischen Wirtschaftsministers, der sich, es ist das Jahr 2027, in den Vorbereitungen zur Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl befindet. Die Welt hat sich aus Houellebeqscher Sicht sichtlich ver\u00e4ndert, die \"Kampfzone\" spielt hier, wenn \u00fcberhaupt, nur eine untergeordnete Rolle: bei grassierender Arbeitslosigkeit ist die Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich so gro\u00df wie nie, eine Mittelschicht existiert praktisch nicht mehr. Gleichzeitig w\u00e4chst die Zahl der Asexuellen mit zunehmender Geschwindigkeit - f\u00fcr sie ist der Kampf ist zuende. Zur gleichen Zeit ersch\u00fcttert eine Serie von Hackerangriffen und Anschl\u00e4gen die Welt, deren Verursacher unbekannt bleiben - eine Nebengeschichte, deren Relevanz im Verlauf des Romans nachl\u00e4sst. \"Familie und Ehe waren die beiden verbliebenen Pole, die das Leben der letzten Bewohner des Abendlands in der ersten H\u00e4lfte des 21. Jahrhunderts ordneten.\" Houellebecq bietet seinem Protagonisten einen Ausweg, Hoffnung: nachdem sein Vater einen Hirnschlag erlitten hat, n\u00e4hert sich Paul sowohl seiner Familie, als auch seiner Frau wieder an. Wollte Houellebecq so Frieden mit der Welt schlie\u00dfen? Dann entt\u00e4uscht mich seine Fantasielosigkeit, generell l\u00e4sst er es in diesem Buch an dem Biss fehlen der ihn sonst auszeichnet. Doch trotz aller von einigen als \"kitschig\" bezeichneten Eskapaden, bleibt der Grundton des Buches eine sanfte Melancholie. Sehr interessant sind die Abschnitte, in denen er dem Westen eine Kapitulation vor dem Nihilismus attestiert, hier l\u00e4sst er einen Ex-Identit\u00e4ren-Anti-Euthanasisten sehr deutlich werden:\"In allen fr\u00fcheren Zivilisationen beruhte die Wertsch\u00e4tzung oder gar die Bewunderung, die man einem Menschen beima\u00df, das, was es erm\u00f6glichte, seinen Wert zu beurteilen, auf der Art und Weise, wie er sich sein Leben lang tats\u00e4chlich verhalten hatte [...]. Indem wir dem Leben eines Kindes einen h\u00f6heren Wert beimessen \u2013 ohne zu wissen, was aus ihm wird, ob es klug oder dumm, ein Genie, ein Verbrecher oder ein Heiliger werden wird -, leugnen wir den Wert unseres tats\u00e4chlichen Handelns. Unsere heldenhaften oder noblen Taten, alles, was wir erreicht haben, unsere Errungenschaften, unser Schaffen, all das hat in den Augen der Welt - und dann sehr bald auch in unseren eigenen Augen - keinen Wert. So entziehen wir dem Leben jeden Ansporn und jeden Sinn; genau das ist es, was man als Nihilismus bezeichnet. Die Vergangenheit und die Gegenwart zugunsten der Zukunft abzuwerten, das Reale zugunsten einer in einer unbestimmten Zukunft verorteten Virtualit\u00e4t abzuwerten, das sind weitaus entscheidendere Symptome des europ\u00e4ischen Nihilismus als alle, die Nietzsche je aufzeigen konnte.\"Insgesamt ein sehr gutes Buch, hoffentlich doch nicht das letzte.", "num_likes": 14, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["franz\u00f6sisch"]}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4426575664", "review_id": "4426575664", "date": "Jan 01, 2022", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Gennaro Duello", "user_url": "/user/show/122419219-gennaro-duello", "text": "\u00c8 tornato lo scrittore pi\u00f9 importante e divisivo al mondo, per questo \u2013 dopo aver letto in anteprima il suo ottavo romanzo \u2013vale la pena dirvelo subito che \u00e8 sempre il solito Michel Houellebecq, ma con una significativa differenza: in \"Annientare\" \u2013 dal 7 gennaio in Italia per La Nave di Teseo e tradotto da Milena Zemira Ciccimarra (in contemporanea con l'edizione originale Flammarion) \u2013 c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9 luce.

Ma il nemico, senza anticipare null'altro, \u00e8 implacabile. Resta la dolcezza di aver fatto un tentativo: \"Avremmo avuto bisogno di meravigliose menzogne\".Di cosa parla il nuovo romanzo di Michel HouellebecqIl protagonista di \"Annientare\" \u00e8 Paul Raison, consigliere di Bruno Juge, un ministro dell'Economia in ascesa, favorito alle prossime elezioni presidenziali francesi. Entrambi condividono una vita coniugale devastata. Bruno \u00e8 un uomo completamente solo, tradito dalla moglie, esposto a uno scandalo pubblico al quale \u00e8 chiamato a far fronte proprio Paul Raison, che vive la sua vita da separato in casa con sua moglie Prudence. Quando un attacco informatico mette in discussione il governo e il futuro politico di Bruno Juge, Paul Raison si trova ad affrontare la tempesta \u2013 \"un mondo umano fatto di tante piccole palline di merda egoistiche\" \u2013 mentre tutto il resto della sua vita privata \u00e8 in procinto di collassare. E in quel momento che Paul ritrover\u00e0 il coraggio necessario per affrontare le cose, proprio perch\u00e9 riuscir\u00e0 a ritrovare un legame con sua moglie Prudence.L'amore coniugale: un equivoco del nostro tempoMarcel Jouhandeau scriveva che la vita coniugale e l'amore che l'abita non ha alcun tipo di rapporto con le cose che si danno per scontate: l'amore stesso, la simpatia, l'amicizia, la sensualit\u00e0, la passione. In \"Annientare\", Bruno e Paul si confessano a vicenda che da mesi non fanno pi\u00f9 l'amore (a voi l'onore di scoprire da quanto tempo). Perch\u00e9, in effetti, l'amore coniugale non puoi ridurlo a nessuno di tutti questi sentimenti. Ha le sue dinamiche. Ha le sue leggi. Ha il suo modo di essere completamente inedito, rilevava Jouhandeau, \"a seconda delle coppie che mette insieme\". Cos\u00ec \u00e8, anche in questo nuovo romanzo di Houellebecq. In tempi di pandemia, lo scrittore ci accontenta \u2013 la prosa \u00e8 sempre densa, le derapate politiche non mancano \u2013 e ci sorprende: scarta il macro e analizza ancora una volta il micro. Perch\u00e9 se non risolviamo le cose che ci sono pi\u00f9 vicine, non possiamo pretendere di risolvere quelle che ci appaiono pi\u00f9 distanti.Anteprima pubblicata per Fanpage.it https://www.fanpage.it/cultura/annien...", "num_likes": 15, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4574282290", "review_id": "4574282290", "date": "Mar 07, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Stratos", "user_url": "/user/show/33767336-stratos", "text": "\u0395\u03be\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae \u03c7\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. \u0398\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u0384 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1. \u039f\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2. \u0395\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ba\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd.", "num_likes": 16, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4399345837", "review_id": "4399345837", "date": "Jan 25, 2022", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Marcello S", "user_url": "/user/show/38785158-marcello-s", "text": "Il mio libro pi\u00f9 atteso dell\u2019anno \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 politico dei romanzi di Houellebecq, ambientato durante la campagna delle elezioni presidenziali francesi del 2027. Risultato decisamente al di sotto delle aspettative. Il problema principale \u00e8 che non si capisce cosa avesse in mente di scrivere, mettendo insieme (1) thriller politico, (2) romanzo famigliare e (3) dramma sulla malattia. Diversi pezzi si perdono per strada e alla fine resta una desolante sensazione di irrisolto. La trama mischia abbastanza a caso un po\u2019 di esoterismo, societ\u00e0 segrete, linguaggi criptati e numerologia occulta. Credo sia, a suo modo, un libro sull\u2019importanza dell\u2019amore (per quanto l\u2019evoluzione del rapporto tra Paul e Prudence sia poco verosimile) e, ancora una volta, sulla decadenza della societ\u00e0 occidentale. Scrittura sottotono, parecchio pi\u00f9 smussata rispetto al passato. Cita pi\u00f9 volte La traversata di Philippe Lan\u00e7on, nel quale Houellebecq stesso \u00e8 citato. Inutilmente lungo: l\u2019edizione italiana pesa 1 chilo abbondante e ha pagine bianchissime che sembrano appena uscite dalla fotocopiatrice dell\u2019ufficio.Molto pi\u00f9 consigliati Le particelle elementari, Piattaforma e Serotonina. Qui manca forse quell\u2019elemento perturbante che d\u00e0 l\u2019impressione di essere costantemente a un passo dalla Verit\u00e0. [60/100]Il cielo \u00e8 basso, grigio, compatto. La luce non sembra venire dall\u2019alto, ma dal manto nevoso che ricopre il suolo; si affievolisce in modo inesorabile, probabilmente sta calando la sera. Chiazze di brina si cristallizzano, i rami degli alberi scricchiolano. Fiocchi di neve turbinano in mezzo alle persone che si incrociano senza vedersi, i loro volti si irrigidiscono e si riempiono di rughe, piccoli punti di luce impazziti danzano nei loro occhi. Alcuni stanno tornando a casa, ma prima di arrivarci capiscono che i loro cari moriranno, o probabilmente sono gi\u00e0 morti.Si era sentito invadere da un\u2019ondata di tristezza spropositata, atroce, era quasi scoppiato in lacrime all\u2019idea che sarebbero morti senza pi\u00f9 rivedersi, anche se non erano mai stati particolarmente intimi, i loro rapporti non erano mai andati oltre quelli tra un medico e il suo paziente, non ricordava nemmeno che avessero mai avuto una vera conversazione, che avessero discusso insieme di argomenti non dentistici. Quello che non poteva sopportare, si era reso conto con inquietudine, era l\u2019impermanenza di per s\u00e9; era l\u2019idea che una cosa, qualunque cosa, finisse; quello che non poteva sopportare, non era altro che una delle condizioni essenziali della vita.In realt\u00e0 riusc\u00ec a parlarle solo nella tarda mattinata di domenica, dopo aver fatto l\u2019amore con lei pi\u00f9 a lungo del solito, e averle dato, ne era sicuro, pi\u00f9 piacere del solito, ma ovviamente non era all\u2019altezza della sfida, ci sarebbe voluto qualcosa come un orgasmo assoluto, tellurico, un orgasmo che potesse giustificare da solo una vita intera, insomma, ci sarebbe voluto qualcosa che non esisteva, tranne forse nei romanzi di Hemingway.Ormai qualsiasi malattia era diventata, in un certo senso, una malattia di cui vergognarsi, e le malattie mortali naturalmente erano quelle di cui c\u2019era da vergognarsi di pi\u00f9. Quanto alla morte, rappresentava la massima indecenza, e si era deciso ben presto di tenerla il pi\u00f9 possibile nascosta.", "num_likes": 13, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4816121291", "review_id": "4816121291", "date": "Jul 09, 2022", "rating": 3, "user_name": "M.C", "user_url": "/user/show/31212474-m-c", "text": "No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 nota poner a esta novela.

Es wirkt, als h\u00e4tte der Autor mehrere unterschiedliche Romane im Kopf gehabt und konnte sich nicht entscheiden, welchen er schreiben will, weshalb er alle zu einem unzufriedenstellenden Mischmasch zusammen getan hat. Viele der eingef\u00fchrten Handlungsstr\u00e4nge und Figuren werden einfach fallen gelassen und nie wieder angesprochen, was \u00e4u\u00dferst unbefriedigend ist.Haupts\u00e4chlich besteht der Roman aus schlichten, weitestgehend uninteressanten Beobachtungen; er ist deutlich zu lang und schlecht komponiert. Die fantasielose Kritik an der Gesellschaft wird nur am Rande erw\u00e4hnt und nicht weiter ausgef\u00fchrt, die Figuren sind uninteressant, um nicht zu sagen langweilig; insbesondere Protagonist Paul ist so apathisch und indifferent, dass es einem schwer f\u00e4llt, selbst Interesse f\u00fcr die Geschehnisse aufzubringen.Das alles ist gesprenkelt mit einer Vielzahl rassistischer und sexistischer Bemerkungen, die mir beim Lesen regelrecht Sodbrennen verursacht haben.

Finger weg von diesem Schinken! Seite f\u00fcr Seite habe ich mich durch diesen Dreck gequ\u00e4lt, jede einzelne Sekunde war verschwendete Lebenszeit. Damit ich es trotzdem schaffte, das Buch zu beenden, habe ich mir verschiedenfarbige Post-Its geschnappt und Stellen im Buch nach folgender Logik gekennzeichnet:ROSA = AnachronismusEin ausgew\u00e4hltes Beispiel (S. 203): \"Er schaltete seinen Computer ein und \u00fcberpr\u00fcfte es rasch: 2027 war tats\u00e4chlich eine Primzahl.\"Da frage ich mich zum einen, warum der Wellbeck-Mischl diese Geschichte unbedingt im Jahr 2027 spielen lassen muss. Und wenn es ihm schon so wichtig ist, das im Jahr 2027 handeln zu lassen - warum zur H\u00f6lle, denkt er nicht dr\u00fcber nach, wie das Leben im Jahr 2027 sein k\u00f6nnte? Das ist nicht so weit weg. Wer von uns w\u00fcrde heute, im Jahr 2022, einen Computer einschalten, um eine Zahl darauf zu pr\u00fcfen, ob sie eine Primzahl ist? Ich w\u00fcrde entweder zum Handy greifen oder sagen: \"Alexa, ist 2027 einen Primzahl?\"Dieser alte Typ ist einfach so unendlich weit weg von jeglicher Realit\u00e4t...Wer noch mehr Anachronismen in diesem Buch sucht, sei z.B. auf die Seiten 33, 37, 180, 200, 305, 328, 381, 445, 483 oder 504 verwiesen. Viel Spa\u00df. LILA = Alter wei\u00dfer MannEin ausgew\u00e4hltes Beispiel (S. 549): \"...Frauen identifizieren sich ohne Weiteres mit ihrer Aufgabe und akzeptieren es ohne Weiteres, dass, wenn ihre Aufgabe beendet ist, auch ihr Leben endet...\"Aus jeder Seite dieses Schundes trieft Misogynie. Der Wellbeck-Mischl entf\u00fchrt uns in eine Welt, in der Frauen eine ganz klar untergeordnete Rolle spielen, in eine Welt, in der es bei Frauen nur auf das Aussehen ankommt - freilich nur bei Frauen, wie die M\u00e4nner aussehen, ist uns egal. Und wenn es doch einmal vorkommt, dass eine Frau wichtig ist, weil sie z.B. die Chef\u00e4rztin der Klinik ist, in der der Vater behandelt wird, dann denkt diese Frau an irgendwelche ehemaligen Politiker, w\u00e4hrend sie mit der Familie spricht, und dann (S. 153): \"...fuhr sie fort, sich mit M\u00fche zusammenrei\u00dfend, weil sie sp\u00fcrte, wie sich in ihrem Schritt etwas Tr\u00fcbes und Feuchtes ausbreitete...\" Insofern gibt es in meiner Kategorisierung auch einige \u00dcberschneidungen zwischen LILA undGELB = WTF?!, was zum Teil die Steigerungsform von LILA darstellt.Ein ausgew\u00e4hltes Beispiel (S. 237): \"Sol\u00e8ne war eine Frau von etwa vierzig Jahren, leicht pummelig, hastig geschminkt, auf den ersten Blick nicht sehr imposant.\"Wir erfahren beim ersten Auftritt einer weiblichen Figur sofort, wie sie aussieht. Die Frau des Protagonisten Paul zum Beispiel, hat offenbar einen ziemlich tollen Hintern. Der tolle Hintern ist auch das einzige, was dieser Charakter in die Geschichte einbringt. Dagegen bekommen wir bis zum Ende keine einzige Information dar\u00fcber, wie Paul, der Protagonist des Buches, aussieht.Einen weiteren sch\u00f6nen WTF-Moment gibt es im Zusammenhang mit dem Vater, der erst im Koma war und dann gel\u00e4hmt und kommunikationsunf\u00e4hig bleibt: \"Wenn sein Vater Erektionen haben konnte, wenn er lesen und die sich im Wind wiegende Bl\u00e4tter betrachten konnte, dann, dachte Paul, fehlte es ihm im Leben an rein gar nichts.\" W!T!F!?Weitere WTF-Momente finden sich u.a. auf den Seiten 90, 126, 148, 307, 317. Viel Spa\u00df damit. GR\u00dcN = Unn\u00f6tigAuf den Seiten 80/81 findet sich eine Zeichnung vom Anwesen der Famile. H\u00fcbsch. Aber v\u00f6llig irrelevant f\u00fcr die Geschichte. Ob diese Zeichnung im Buch ist oder nicht, macht keinen Unterscheid. Ebenso wirft der Wellbeck-Mischl immer wieder mit irgendwelchen Informationen zu St\u00e4dtenamen oder sonstigen Dingen um sich, die absolut keine Relevanz haben. Das Buch wird dadurch dicker, schwerer, m\u00fchsamer, schlechter. Ganz besonders seien hier die letzten beiden Teile VI und VII erw\u00e4hnt. Paul hat Krebs, wird auf eigenen Wunsch unzureichend behandelt und wird wohl bald sterben. Punkt. Daf\u00fcr braucht niemand 130 Seiten. Vor allem, weil die einzige Storyline, die in diesem Buch spannend gewesen w\u00e4re, ab Teil VI pl\u00f6tzlich verschwindet und nicht mehr aufgegriffen wird. V\u00f6llig bescheuert.BLAU = H\u00c4?Ein ausgew\u00e4hltes Beispiel (S. 414): \"...die Mutter-Tochter-Beziehung ist nie einfach, vor allem, wenn die Tochter h\u00fcbsch ist.\"Was man vom Wellbeck-Mischl erwartet, ist Frauenfeindlichkeit - man wird nicht entt\u00e4uscht. Dennoch wirft er dann oft mit derma\u00dfen Lilagelbgr\u00fcnen Aussagen um sich, dass man am liebsten rufen m\u00f6chte: H\u00c4? Worauf willst du hinaus, du verdorrter Froschfresser? Worum geht es dir, du versoffene Kanaille? Wie soll das in irgendeiner Art und Weise f\u00fcr die Geschichte von Relevanz sein, du seniles Baguette?Weitere H\u00c4?-Momente sind, als auf Seite 96 pl\u00f6tzlich die Indirekte Rede verwendet wird. Oder die unz\u00e4hligen Traum-Sequenzen (was macht Paul eigentlich sonst so, au\u00dfer seiner Frau auf den Arsch zu schauen, zu tr\u00e4umen und an Krebs zu sterben?) die zum Teil - wie der Rest des Buches - im Pr\u00e4teritum, auf den Seiten 48, 178 und 411 aber im Pr\u00e4sens niedergeschrieben sind. Why? Warum l\u00e4sst das Lektorat so etwas durch? Das hat in diesem Buch weder einen literarischen, noch einen k\u00fcstlerischen Mehrwert?!ORANGE = \"Vernichten\"Das Wort \"Vernichten\" kommt in Abwandlung nur ein einziges Mal im Buch vor, auf Seite 200. Und fast bin ich jetzt gerade versucht, einen zweiten Stern zu vergeben. Weil vielleicht hat der Wellbeck-Mischl absichtlich so ein mieses Buch abgeliefert, damit man nichts anderes damit tun m\u00f6chte, als es zu ... vernichten.Au\u00dferdem lustig: ab Teil IV liest sich das Buch etwas besser. Es ist immer noch m\u00fchsam und uninteressant, aber nicht mehr ganz so unangenehm zu lesen. Eine vermeintliche Erkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr dieses Ph\u00e4nomen ist, dass die ersten 3 Teile und die folgenden 4 von zwei unterschiedlichen Person (beides mutma\u00dflich alte wei\u00dfe M\u00e4nner) ins Deutsche \u00fcbersetzt wurden.Und noch ein Gustost\u00fcckerl zum Schluss, um zu zeigen, wie fern jeglicher Realit\u00e4t der greise und vermutlich nicht mehr wirklich zurechnungsf\u00e4hige Wellbeck-Mischl inzwischen ist. Auf Seite 129 schreibt er von den Trilogien Matrix und Herr der Ringe. Wir erinnern uns, dass die Geschichte im Jahr 2027 spielt. Das Buch erschien im Original im Jahr 2022. Matrix Ressurection, der 4. Teil dieser Trilogie (*zwinker*) erschien 2021, bereits 2019 wurde bekannt gegeben, dass es diesen Film geben w\u00fcrde. Jeder normale Mensch h\u00e4tte es geschafft, das zu recherchieren, im Auge zu behalten und einzuarbeiten. Hier haben der Wellbeck-Mischl und auch sein Lektorat (mutma\u00dflich wohl alles alte wei\u00dfe M\u00e4nner...) komplett versagt. (Ja, auf dieser Seite findet sich ein blaues Post-It.)In der Leserunde, in der wir dieses Buch gelesen haben, sind wir einhellig der Meinung, dass es genau einen Stern verdient. Und warum? Weil man hier auf Goodreads nicht 0 Sterne vergeben kann. Egal, was wir als n\u00e4chstes in unserem Buchclub lesen, es wird auf jeden Fall deutlich besser sein.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4697546573", "review_id": "4697546573", "date": "Apr 30, 2022", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Wandaviolett", "user_url": "/user/show/37499031-wandaviolett", "text": "Vom Leben und vom Sterben.Kurzmeinung: Ich kann nicht anders, ich muss alle Sterne vergeben!Grob gesagt geht es ums Sterben.

Und doch, wie Michel Houellebecq das macht, wie er sein Sujet handhabt, das ist schon grandios, Er schleicht sich von hinten an dich ran.  Was ich an Michel Houellebecqs Romanen bisher (lediglich gelesen: Unterwerfung, abgebrochen: Serotonin) mag, das ist vor allem der jeweilige politische Kontext. In \u201eVernichten\u201c wie in \u201eUnterwerfung\u201c schaut der Autor auf Frankreich. Zwar siedelt er das Romangeschehen beide Male um ein Weniges in der Zukunft an, doch hat er ein scharfes Auge auf die gesellschaftlichen, sozialen und politischen Verh\u00e4ltnisse im Land. Seine Analysen sind messerscharf.  Im vorliegenden Roman nimmt Houellebecq vor allem den Wahlkampf ins Visier, zeigt die Verflechtungen, Berechnungen und die Manipulationen auf, die die Wahlkampfagenturen aushecken. Politiker werden geschult, jedes Wort, das sie im Interview sagen, wurde gebrieft; der Kandidat wird mit seinem Privatleben unter die Lupe genommen; nichts bleibt vor dem Skalpell verschont: passt, passt nicht, muss ver\u00e4ndert werden, verst\u00e4rkt, darf nie ans Licht kommen, etc. etc. Letztlich geht es immer darum, wie verkaufen wir die \u00d6ffentlichkeit f\u00fcr dumm? Laut Houellebecq. Zwischen den Zeilen. Doch da steckt mehr als ein K\u00f6rnchen Wahrheit darin. Der Wirtschaftsminister, der den Kandidaten massiv unterst\u00fctzt, und der eine gute Stimme hat, lernt zuhause Arien zu singen, und rezitiert Gedichte. So kommt sein Timbre noch besser an. Er bekommt auch eine intelligente junge Geliebte, damit er nach einer gescheiterten Ehe bessere Laune ausstrahlt. Das ist Bruno Juge, der Minister, der arbeitsbesessen sozusagen im Ministerium wohnt und dem Paul, dem Protagonisten, als pers\u00f6nlicher Assistent unterstellt ist. Eine gut bezahlte Vertrauensstellung.  Mit Paul kommt die private Komponente ins Buch. Die Familie. Schwelende Konflikte, scheiternde Ehen, ungel\u00f6ste Fragen, Suizid, Krankheit, Tod. Sex scheint das einzige Verteidigungsmittel zu sein, das einem Mann gegen das Herannahen des Todes zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Vergessen wir nicht, es ist ein Houellebecq, den wir lesen! Frauen haben eine dienende Rolle. Sie sind allzeit bereit, st\u00e4ndig am Mann interessiert und erfreuen ihn sexuell. Das machen sie freiwillig und gern und umsonst! Wie Raxanne eben, die Wahlkampfassistentin von Bruno!Eine einzige Ausnahme ist Sol\u00e8ne Signal, die Chefin der Werbeagentur, Pr\u00e4sidentenmacherin, sie ist nat\u00fcrlich unsympathisch und kommandiert alle rum und hat (wahrscheinlich) ein Verh\u00e4ltnis mit ihrem Assistenten, der insofern kein richtiger Mann ist.  \u201eEinem wirklichen Schriftsteller kann es gelingen, uns an den Tod zu erinnern. An unseren ganz pers\u00f6nlichen Tod. Jeder wei\u00df, dass das Leben irgendwann endet. Aber selten machen wir uns klar, dass wir selbst es sind, die sterben werden. W\u00e4hrend die Welt unger\u00fchrt weiterexistiert. Literatur \u00f6ffnet uns manchmal f\u00fcr Momente die Augen f\u00fcr diese Wahrheit, vor der wir sie sonst zumeist schlie\u00dfen\u201c. Das sagt Marcel Reich-Ranicki in Fokus Online vom 9.9.2015 von Uwe Wittstock: Hat Houellebecq dies geschafft? Ist ihm diese Auseinandersetzung mit uns selbst gelungen? Die Schilderung einer schlimmen Krankheit, einer sehr seltenen Krankheit sogar, ist dann doch zu selten; so dass man sich zwar entsetzt, aber man identifiziert sich nicht.Man ist nicht angefasst, wie man heute so sch\u00f6n sagt. Je mehr sich der Autor vom Sog des Privaten einsaugen l\u00e4sst und uns, die Leser, einzusaugen versucht, desto mehr entfernt er sich von seinem spannenden Ausgangskonzept. Cybermobbing und Cyberterrorismus. Es gerieten dubiose Sektierer in den Fokus der Ermittlungen. Und der Autor stellte mittels seiner Figuren manche \u00dcberlegungen an, die der Komik nicht entbehrten. Wiccaisten treten auf. Katholische Aktivisten. Leider bleibt aber dieser Strang lose in der Luft h\u00e4ngen. Gerade noch den Ausgang der Wahl bekommen die Leser am Rande noch so mitgeteilt. Und dass Bruno darauf spekuliert, selber Kandidat zu werden, war von Anfang an keine \u00dcberraschung. Der Erkrankte hat das Interesse an Politik verloren. Verst\u00e4ndlich. Der Leser aber nicht.Im Privaten geht es weiterhin um die Krankheit des Vaters: Apoplexie. Pauls Familie ist wirklich arg gebeutelt! Wie geht die Familie damit um? Wie die \u00d6ffentlichkeit? Wie das Gesundheitssystem. Hier ist man st\u00e4ndig am Nicken. Liegt doch so vieles gesellschaftlich im Argen. Krankheit und Alter per se scheint ein Angriff auf die Jungen und Gesunden zu sein. Und ein Krankenhaus oder eine Pflegeeinrichtung sind Welten f\u00fcr sich. Abgeschlossene Welten. Es gibt nur Drinnen oder Drau\u00dfen.  Um sich dagegen Vereinnahmung auf Seiten des Gesundheitswesens (eigentlich Krankheitsverwaltung) einerseits und gegen die Abschiebung in die Unsichtbarkeit und damit in die Nichtexistenz zu behaupten, gibt es nur die Werkzeuge Verm\u00f6gen und Hingabe. Nur die Wohlhabenden k\u00f6nnen sich die beste Behandlung sichern, dh. eine menschenw\u00fcrdige, und nur die Menschen, die jemanden haben, der sie mit Hingabe betreut, haben noch ein lebenswertes Dasein. Und wer pflegt voller Hingabe und Leidenschaft und Opferbereitschaft? Frauen. Und wer wird im Gesundheitssystem ausgenutzt: ausl\u00e4ndische Pflegekr\u00e4fte. Weiblich. Houellebecqs Roman ist vielf\u00e4ltig und komplex. Und obwohl er mich zuletzt im Regen stehen l\u00e4sst, wie seinerzeit Steinfests \u201eDas gr\u00fcne Rollo\u201c, ist er auch genial. In den Traumbildern, die Houellebecq alle Naselang entlang des gesamten Romans pr\u00e4sentiert, treffen sich jeweils zwei Ebenen, eine Surreale und eine des Horrors. Mit Fug und Recht kann man sie als Verarbeitungsproze\u00df interpretieren, eine Reaktion des Unterbewusstseins auf die Todesbedrohung. Am meisten liebe ich die Beschreibungen der Landschaft, die der Sterbende noch einmal intensiv erlebt. Wunderbarst die Hommage an die Natur. Ich kann den Wald atmen. Der gesamte Wald wird von einem Wind gebeugt, stark und doch sanft. Die letzte Phase des Sterbeprozesses wird dadurch symbolisiert, ein Bild der Ruhe: die vollkommene Akzeptanz. Fazit: Trotz einiger Abstriche und trotz des vermittelten Frauenbildes, bei dem man nie wei\u00df, wie es gemeint ist, als blo\u00dfes Abbild des Realen (Frau tr\u00e4gt ja tats\u00e4chlich die Last der Pflege und des sozialen Leben und sie ist Sexdienstleisterin) oder als Wunschbild, es m\u00f6ge so bleiben, ist \u201eVernichten\u201c selbstverst\u00e4ndlich gro\u00dfe Literatur.

C\u2019est le seul livre o\u00f9 l\u2019on parle d\u2019yttrium, de gadolinium, de lanthane, de samarium et de pras\u00e9odyme. C\u2019est un livre sur la mort, la maladie, la vieillesse, l\u2019amour, le couple et ses d\u00e9sillusions. p. 104 \u00ab En tant que repr\u00e9sentants des CSP++ ils n\u2019entendaient pas d\u00e9roger, et accordaient une grande importance \u00e0 ce que le naufrage de leur couple se d\u00e9roule dans des conditions de civilisation optimales \u00bb. L\u2019auteur d\u00e9crit tr\u00e8s bien notre \u00e9poque, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, l\u2019emballement m\u00e9diatique, le paysage audiovisuel contemporain et ses \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9alit\u00e9 humiliantes d\u00e9gradantes aux audiences exponentielles, la place du storytelling et de la communication, celle des influenceurs aux \u00ab ego aussi d\u00e9mesur\u00e9s que lamentables \u00bb.

Mais il est remont\u00e9 dans mon estime puisque dans ce roman, les femmes ont une vraie place. Le personnage de Madeleine est touchant, C\u00e9cile incarne l\u2019aidante dans toute sa splendeur, celui de Maryse est attendrissant, j\u2019\u00e9tais en totale empathie avec Prudence, une fille asexuelle qui ne cuisine pas, v\u00e9gane, amatrice de yoga et de m\u00e9diation transcendantale, il y a encore la coach du cabinet de consulting politique qui campe le r\u00f4le de la femme moderne ind\u00e9pendante et conqu\u00e9rante. Je n\u2019aime pas du tout les passages oniriques. Ils sont obscurs et n\u2019ajoutent rien au propos. Je n\u2019avais pas un dictionnaire des r\u00eaves \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main. Une fois le livre referm\u00e9 je ne saisis pas la premi\u00e8re partie avec ce triple attentat si ce n\u2019est pour parler et critiquer les activistes d\u2019ultragauche, les catholiques int\u00e9gristes, les satanistes, les anarcho-primitivistes, les supr\u00e9macistes blancs (\u00ab Trois paum\u00e9s incapables de lacer leurs chaussures \u00bb), les \u00e9colo-fascistes, les nihilistes, les membres de la deep ecology.

Die Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl 2027 steht an, begleitet wird sie von einer Reihe von scheinbar nicht zusammenh\u00e4ngenden terroristischen Anschl\u00e4gen. Pauls Ehe findet nicht nur in zwei Schlafzimmern statt, er und Prudence laufen sich in der gemeinsamen Wohnung nicht mehr \u00fcber den Weg. Sein Vater liegt im Koma und nachdem er aufwacht kann er nur eingeschr\u00e4nkt mit Blinzeln und H\u00e4ndedruck kommunizieren.Doch, die Hoffnungslosigkeit gewinnt nicht vollst\u00e4ndig. Die Anschl\u00e4ge, die sich dem ideologischen Vorbild Kaczynskis annehmen, werden durchschaut - Pauls Ehe erlebt eine Renaissance, sein Vater kann den elenden Pflegebedingungen entkommen, seine neue Frau und Tochter k\u00fcmmern sich liebevoll um ihn. W\u00e4hrend sich im gesamten Roman politisches und privates vermischen, wird ein Unterschied klar: Die Rettung ist nur noch im kleinen, privaten, im famili\u00e4ren oder freundschaftlichen zu finden. Politische Anteilnahme geht zur\u00fcck, die Wahl ist nur noch Formalit\u00e4t zur Verhinderung des Rassemblement National (in 40 Minuten gibt es die Hochrechnungen der diesj\u00e4hrigen Stichwahl, ich bete). Niemand hat noch die Illusion, der (positiven) Demokratischen Ver\u00e4nderung. Globalisierte Prozesse sind undurchsichtig, doch h\u00e4ngt alles an Ihnen - die Finanzierung der terroristischen Anschl\u00e4ge ist wie die Lebensqualit\u00e4t der westlichen Welt an das Kapital gebunden.Durchdrungen wird der Roman durch mehr oder weniger verst\u00e4ndliche und eindeutige Traumsequenzen, Paul ger\u00e4t dort in Gefahr, wird sich seiner Klasse bewusst, zumindest findet er im Schlaf keine Ruhe mehr. Der Roman ist Fiktion, es wirkt an vielen Stellen leider zu real. Houellebecq kommt fast g\u00e4nzlich ohne Vulgarit\u00e4t aus, noch sch\u00e4rfer sind die Beschreibungen, noch kreativer der Aufbau. Neben ausf\u00fchrlicher wirtschaftlicher und politischer Analysen kommt auch die Beschreibung derjenigen nicht zu kurz, die nicht apathisch und ohne Hoffnung f\u00fcr das Gesamte weiterleben, sondern aufgeben vor aller Last. Paul wirkt weniger resigniert als viele vorige Hauptfiguren, sein Werdegang, die unendliche Tragik und Liebe der letzten 100 Seiten sind das Beste, Sch\u00f6nste und Mitrei\u00dfendste was ich je gelesen habe. Insgesamt bleibt - das Leben im Kleinen lohnt sich, sei der Sinn in Nachmittagen im Park, Arthur Conan Doyle Geschichten w\u00e4hrend der Chemotherapie - oder dem f\u00fcnf st\u00fcndigen, schweigenden Sitzen neben dem sterbenden Vater. Falls dies, wie im Nachwort angedeutet, der letzte Roman Houellebcqs war - Abschluss mit einem Meisterwerk. Was hier erw\u00e4hnt wurde, war nur die Spitze, der Roman ist ein Aleph der Gegenwart.

Por una parte, resulta un experimento muy interesante desde el punto de vista literario y filos\u00f3fico \u2014a\u00fan cuando Houellebecq me resulte especialmente cargante y simplista en sus planteamientos\u2014, y sin duda logra un poderoso andamiaje emocional, sustentado en personajes ricos y bien construidos, que se fusionan a las mil maravillas con la(s) trama(s).De su t\u00e9cnica, qu\u00e9 decir: Houellebecq es un gran escritor, de eso no cabe duda, y sale siempre con la cabeza alta de sus novelas. En esta en concreto, me ha sorprendido la cantidad de recursos que utiliza, como si fuera un cat\u00e1logo en el que mostrase lo que es capaz de hacer con un teclado ante sus manos.Pero, en \u00faltima instancia, creo que no ha conseguido con \u201cAniquilaci\u00f3n\u201d todo lo que pretend\u00eda. La sensaci\u00f3n que deja es de que a media novela, tras divagar y divagar a lo largo de cientos de p\u00e1ginas, se rinde ante la falta de soluciones a la que enfrenta y opta por cambiar el foco hacia otros elementos de la trama. Para m\u00ed, un acierto total, pues esta parte final ha sido para m\u00ed la m\u00e1s lograda, emocionante, personal y disfrutable desde el punto de vista literario. Si se hubiese dedicado a eso desde el principio, nos encontrar\u00edamos ante toda una novela total.En definitiva, \u201cAniquilaci\u00f3n\u201d empieza como una suerte de semi-distop\u00eda pol\u00edtica, en un estilo cercano al thriller. Ese camino se va secando poco a poco hasta que deriva en una obra mucho m\u00e1s intimista, en la que Houellebecq abandona a su suerte la trama principal (que queda irresuelta) para concentrarse en una historia m\u00e1s cercana a sus intereses (obsesiones), como son la muerte, la enfermedad, los cambios que trae el multiculturalismo, las diferencias generacionales, etc. Consigue enlazar ambas derivas con una cierta maestr\u00eda, pero que suena a excusa a mis o\u00eddos.Al final, creo que Houellebecq es un autor \u00fanico, que te tiene que gustar para disfrutarlo. Personalmente, no termino de entrar en su mundo, que me resulta tan provocador como enojoso e irritante. Y sospecho que mucho tiene que ver en un choque generacional entre \u00e9l y yo: me cuesta mucho entrar en la forma que tiene de entender la sexualidad, la feminidad, el amor, la sociedad, etc. Quiz\u00e1s con el tiempo, cuando haya m\u00e1s distancia y se le pueda leer como un cl\u00e1sico.

Tutte queste tematiche sono perfettamente armonizzate tra loro e la narrazione scorre liscia come l'olio, inarrestabile come un fiume in piena e irresistibilmente accattivante.Houellebecq crea tantissimi personaggi, tutti caratterizzati in maniera eccellente e tutti cos\u00ec unici e diversi tra loro, ma soprattutto tutti talmente veri che \u00e8 impossibile non empatizzare, non provare per loro antipatia o simpatia, comprensione o frustrazione.Ma, c'\u00e8 un \"ma\".

Como en todos sus libros, los protagonistas se encuentran embarrados en la anomia social y como en cada novela estos encuentran redenci\u00f3n en el amor (pese a su visi\u00f3n atroz de las relaciones humanas). Si Houllebecq ha hablado de algo es que del horror y del dolor de la existencia solo pueden salvarnos los otros (pero es solo un capricho o una afortunada coincidencia que suceda, he ah\u00ed el horror). La \u00fanica diferencia en esta novela, es que el amor prevalece hasta el final (ok, redenci\u00f3n pero el horror o el sin sentido persisten en forma de degradaci\u00f3n fisica, como en tantas otras novelas).La trama de los terroristas anarco-primitivistas es excitante al principio pero resulta finalmente insatisfactoria al estar muy superficialmente ligada a la trama principal.

Dans An\u00e9antir, il commence par nous entra\u00eener dans une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 propos de surprenants ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, puis il s\u2019int\u00e9resse aux arcanes du pouvoir, avant de nous placer (longuement) au c\u0153ur d\u2019un roman familial et de conclure sur le r\u00e9cit d\u2019une maladie.Voil\u00e0 donc quatre directions de d\u00e9veloppement dont les dynamiques me semblent fort diff\u00e9rentes ; de plus l\u2019auteur leur donne un ton sp\u00e9cifique, une couleur marqu\u00e9e qui les distinguent nettement les unes des autres :\u2013 l\u2019\u00e9nigme dont chacun attend une r\u00e9solution n\u2019en conna\u00eetra aucune, pas m\u00eame vague ; elle passe peu \u00e0 peu au second plan, puis s\u2019enlise, dispara\u00eet au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se de complot assez vague. Le ton se fait ici tr\u00e8s technique, descriptif, factuel, explicatif, il d\u00e9taille toutes les hypoth\u00e8ses, aussi bien le cyberterrorisme que les sectes ou le terrorisme \u2018\u00e9colo\u2019 ultra.\u2013 les m\u00e9canismes du pouvoir qui semblent fasciner l\u2019auteur composent un mouvement perp\u00e9tuel.

L\u2019auteur insiste sur les rouages et la m\u00e9canique bien huil\u00e9e, son admiration se porte, sobrement, sur les qualit\u00e9s de comp\u00e9tence, d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, de r\u00e9ussite, sur l\u2019usage des outils rh\u00e9toriques, de l\u2019analyse.\u2013 le roman familial postulant par d\u00e9finition la continuit\u00e9 n\u2019a aucune raison de s\u2019arr\u00eater, l\u2019auteur doit donc l\u2019interrompre, le couper, abandonnant \u00e0 leurs sorts les protagonistes auxquels il s\u2019est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 pendant plusieurs \u00e9pisodes de leur saga. La famille suscite un int\u00e9r\u00eat, inattendu chez l\u2019auteur (selon moi), pour le d\u00e9tail des petites choses qui caract\u00e9risent les relations intrafamiliales, la diversit\u00e9 des personnalit\u00e9s et de leurs comportements, leurs psychologies. Le r\u00e9cit d\u00e9crit beaucoup, explique, rend cr\u00e9dible en d\u00e9tail les relations interpersonnelles et pose, du point de vue des personnages, leurs questionnements sur les situations auxquelles ils sont confront\u00e9s. Un peu d\u2019humour, mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup de gravit\u00e9.\u2013 enfin la maladie qui cl\u00f4ture l\u2019ouvrage a une temporalit\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par une obsession naturelle de la fin, dont le corps m\u00e9dical est somm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de pr\u00e9ciser l\u2019heure et la nature. La maladie fait l\u2019objet \u00e0 la fois d\u2019une information m\u00e9dicale tr\u00e8s technique, explicite et d\u2019une r\u00e9flexion sensible sur les fins derni\u00e8res et les ultimes rebonds d\u2019une vie de couple.On notera que ces histoires m\u00eal\u00e9es parlent toutes d\u2019une forme d\u2019an\u00e9antissement dans le grand chaudron de l\u2019impermanence des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, ruine de toute construction, de toute ambition, de toute vertu. Peut-\u00eatre l\u2019un des sens du titre ? Sans doute, d\u2019autant que les quatre trames peuvent \u00eatre per\u00e7ues comme quatre figures progressivement plus graves de cet an\u00e9antissement universel.Ce parti g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est suffisamment habile et bien conduit pour conserver au lecteur un int\u00e9r\u00eat soutenu jusqu\u2019au terme de ce tr\u00e8s gros livre (plus de 700 pages). Moins cynique que dans ses ouvrages ant\u00e9rieurs, l\u2019auteur empreint sa narration crois\u00e9e d\u2019une grande sensibilit\u00e9 qui naturellement trouve \u00e0 se d\u00e9ployer avec pudeur et force dans son dernier segment. Certes Houellebecq nous provoque toujours avec son insistance sur le sexe, sa fascination de l\u2019argent et des puissants, son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les grosses cylindr\u00e9es et une certaine commis\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pauvres\u2026 Mais il sait prendre ses distances par rapport \u00e0 ces obsessions, il leur donne une \u00e9nergie plus apais\u00e9e, une distance souriante. Comme s\u2019il donnait au sexe quelque chose de mignon, presque toujours tendre ou dr\u00f4le. Comme si la richesse prenait une dimension toute illusoire. Comme si la puissance politique relevait d\u2019un jeu, savant et passionnant, mais un jeu (avec les passe-droits comme les raccourcis accord\u00e9s au jeu de l\u2019oie)\u2026 Et m\u00eame si les mini-shorts semblent beaucoup lui plaire, l\u2019auteur prend ses distances avec les stars des m\u00e9dias et sa fascination un peu lassante pour l\u2019aisance financi\u00e8re.\u2013 Il ne s\u2019interdit pas dans la phase politique du r\u00e9cit de nourrir sa fiction d\u2019allusions amus\u00e9es au pr\u00e9sent de notre pays. On remarquera par exemple que l\u2019action se d\u00e9roule en 2027, le pr\u00e9sident, jamais nomm\u00e9 (mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la fin de son second mandat), ne peut plus se repr\u00e9senter pour un troisi\u00e8me mandat. Il s\u2019arrange pour faire \u00e9lire un homme de paille suffisamment m\u00e9diocre afin de pr\u00e9parer sa r\u00e9\u00e9lection triomphale en 2032\u2026 \u00e0 moins que le ministre de l\u2019\u00c9conomie et du Budget (celui-l\u00e0 dont Paul fut un temps conseiller) n\u2019ait pris d\u2019ici l\u00e0 le go\u00fbt et l\u2019assurance de lui tenir t\u00eate. La fa\u00e7on dont Houellebecq \u00e9voque l\u2019ambition et les m\u00e9thodes de notre actuel pr\u00e9sident est remarquable et sonne juste, \u00e0 mon sens elle se teinte d\u2019une admiration \u00e0 peine retenue. L\u2019auteur braque souvent son projecteur en direction du cabinet de coaching qui fabrique la communication des hommes politiques en vue ; sans outrance, plut\u00f4t m\u00eame avec un sourire complice. \u2013Mais sur l\u2019ensemble de la trajectoire romanesque prennent les devants de la sc\u00e8ne d\u2019autres sujets de pr\u00e9occupation, \u00e9loign\u00e9s de ces \u00ab\u2009divertissements\u2009\u00bb qui deviennent le d\u00e9cor lointain de l\u2019essentiel (\u00e0 moins que l\u2019impossible de cet \u00ab\u2009essentiel\u2009\u00bb ne leur conf\u00e8re du coup une apparence n\u00e9cessaire ou contingente, mais toujours d\u00e9risoire\u2026).Car la mati\u00e8re de Houellebecq, son propos dans An\u00e9antir, ne s\u2019arr\u00eate pas aux paillettes. An\u00e9antir place au c\u0153ur de ses d\u00e9veloppements, et de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuse, la situation m\u00e9taphysique de l\u2019homme d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui qui s\u2019est volontairement plac\u00e9 sous un ciel vide tout en entassant autour de lui une multitude de joujoux qui occupent et distraient son esprit. Houellebecq s\u2019int\u00e9resse ainsi \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019homme se rattache \u00e0 diverses croyances. Tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8tement, il attire l\u2019attention sur les lieux, les hommes, les femmes, qui accueillent l\u2019angoisse n\u00e9e de la souffrance et de la d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rance de ce monde. Il est donc beaucoup question de mort, de survie v\u00e9g\u00e9tative, d\u2019h\u00f4pital, d\u2019Ehpad, de maladie, de soins palliatifs, de m\u00e9decins, de suicide, de solitude, de fragilit\u00e9 (et m\u00eame de foi !).On conna\u00eet l\u2019engagement de l\u2019auteur s\u2019opposant \u00e0 la l\u00e9galisation de l\u2019euthanasie. Il esquisse la fa\u00e7on dont, avec un peu d\u2019aide ext\u00e9rieure, la dignit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9e, m\u00eame dans les pires situations. Il dessine par exemple avec une remarquable pudeur le portrait d\u2019un homme atteint d\u2019un AVC, \u00c9douard, le p\u00e8re de Paul, personnage pivot du roman. Il se d\u00e9gage de la pr\u00e9sence/absence de cet homme une force inalt\u00e9rable, paradoxale. Son \u00e9tat semble ne plus rendre imp\u00e9ratifs les dialogues explicites, \u00c9douard se red\u00e9finit toute une vie au-del\u00e0 de la parole. Comme profitant de l\u2019immobilit\u00e9 de son personnage, Houellebecq d\u00e9veloppe une description sensible des paysages o\u00f9 il semble rev\u00eatir la nature d\u2019une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure. J\u2019avais lu peu auparavant Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, et le parall\u00e8le avec le personnage de Noirtier, immobile et mutique qui ne communique plus que par clignement des yeux, m\u2019a frapp\u00e9 : il d\u00e9gage chez Dumas la m\u00eame aura positive, une tranquillit\u00e9 d\u2019au-del\u00e0 du temps pr\u00e9sent que je retrouve dans le personnage mutique d\u2019\u00c9douard chez Houellebecq. Le rapprochement va d\u2019ailleurs plus loin, car ce personnage se place en position clef dans le roman, chez Houellebecq (comme chez Dumas o\u00f9 Noirtier d\u00e9noue la situation dramatique) : \u00c9douard dispose sans doute d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019explication de l\u2019\u00e9nigme/il fut par moment proche des arcanes du pouvoir/il est au centre des conflits familiaux/enfin la maladie le laisse paradoxalement survivre \u00e0 ses deux fils. Houellebecq manie l\u2019\u00e9motion avec un tact qui montre que les circonstances lui sont sensibles, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame douloureuses.La personnalit\u00e9 de Paul peut sembler assez p\u00e2le, souvent passive, il se montre volontiers neurasth\u00e9nique, d\u00e9sabus\u00e9 et peu ambitieux. Cependant, sa position sociale (tr\u00e8s privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, Houellebecq ne cache jamais son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les \u00ab\u2009premiers de cord\u00e9e\u2009\u00bb) serait-elle ce qu\u2019elle est (inspecteur des finances et conseiller d\u2019un ministre d\u2019importance) sans un minimum d\u2019ambition ? Ce point demeure en suspens, en myst\u00e8re, de m\u00eame que tout son pass\u00e9, Houellebecq s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout au pr\u00e9sent de ses personnages, il ne proc\u00e8de pas du tout \u00e0 l\u2019arch\u00e9ologie des situations. La cinquantaine de Paul semble domin\u00e9e par une forme de sid\u00e9ration sur ce qu\u2019il est, sur le sens de sa vie, et de la vie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il y a un peu de L\u2019\u00e9tranger dans la figure de Paul. L\u2019ordonnancement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dont il est partie prenante en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s, ne semble gu\u00e8re le concerner, il est un t\u00e9moin, t\u00e9moin inform\u00e9, conscient, parfois inquiet, mais d\u2019abord pos\u00e9 dans sa mission d\u2019observation. L\u2019auteur se sert donc davantage du regard de son personnage que de ses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 faire avancer le r\u00e9cit. En op\u00e9rant de la sorte, il le rapproche insensiblement du lecteur qui s\u2019identifie de plus en plus ais\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa situation, de plus en plus sensible \u00e0 tous. Paul est ainsi :\u2013 un observateur privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9nigme et de ses \u00e9volutions, dont il rend compte au ministre dont il est le conseiller. Le roman d\u00e9bute comme une fiction entre espionnage et policier, dont tout lecteur a la pratique habituelle ;\u2013 un animateur investi dans les m\u00e9caniques du pouvoir, qui l\u2019amusent plus qu\u2019elles ne le motivent (il fait son devoir, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le sort l\u2019a plac\u00e9\u2026). Le texte se complique par une fiction (est-ce le bon mot, tant on est proche de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ?) politique qui retient les nombreux esprits curieux des coulisses du pouvoir ;\u2013 il joue un r\u00f4le discret dans la famille dont il recueille les dol\u00e9ances et les souffrances ou les contradictions, il s\u2019essaie \u00e0 reconqu\u00e9rir une \u00e9pouse falote. Le lecteur se sent concern\u00e9 plus personnellement par la saga familiale qui r\u00e9sonne du v\u00e9cu de tout un chacun dans sa propre famille ;\u2013 enfin, assez passif ou fataliste, il subit sa maladie. Les traumatismes physiques et psychologiques, les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s du v\u00e9cu d\u2019une pathologie lourde et fatale engendrent une empathie forte pour le personnage de Paul dans la derni\u00e8re partie du roman (cette fois, l\u2019identification du lecteur s\u2019op\u00e8re sur le mode : pourvu que je ne connaisse pas cela !)Il faudrait ajouter une sorte particuli\u00e8re de \u00ab\u2009vision int\u00e9rieure\u2009\u00bb : les nombreux r\u00eaves de Paul, toujours violents, angoissants, qui ouvrent une porte sur ce qui r\u00e8gne dans son subconscient tourment\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a pas l\u00e0 mati\u00e8re \u00e0 introspection, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9tation, juste une succession d\u2019images \u00e9tranges, inqui\u00e9tantes, laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 la libre disposition du lecteur.Paul se d\u00e9pouille peu \u00e0 peu de tous les oripeaux sociaux dont il est rev\u00eatu comme nous tous. M\u00eame si certains de ceux-ci paraissent brillants dans le lointain, ils sont devenus d\u00e9risoires au final de cette \u00e9volution qui tient \u00e0 une modification progressive de notre regard induite par l\u2019auteur (un an\u00e9antissement ?). La sc\u00e8ne finale o\u00f9 les deux \u00e9poux se retrouvent dans la for\u00eat de Compi\u00e8gne me semble une tr\u00e8s belle conclusion pudique de l\u2019histoire de Paul, dont on devine qu\u2019elle va s\u2019achever dans peu de temps. Les \u00e9changes devenus rares (au-del\u00e0 de la parole d\u00e9j\u00e0, comme avec \u00c9douard, le p\u00e8re ?) postulent une r\u00e9incarnation o\u00f9 le couple continuerait son \u00e9volution spirituelle. Sont-ils si s\u00fbrs de leur foi dans cet avenir qui n\u00e9cessite de multiples an\u00e9antissements afin de se parfaire ?An\u00e9antir est un roman du d\u00e9pouillement qui incite le lecteur \u00e0 se d\u00e9tacher des intrigues traditionnelles pour se rapprocher de l\u2019essentiel, de l\u2019homme dans sa nudit\u00e9 radicale, m\u00e9taphysique, son angoisse existentielle, celle de notre temps, celle de l\u2019homme en tout temps. Pascal est souvent cit\u00e9, et ce n\u2019est ni hasard ni moquerie. Michel Houellebecq (avec quelques pas de c\u00f4t\u00e9 amusants ou cyniques, somme toute rares en 700 pages) propose \u00e0 notre lecture un roman tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux, grave. Il y prolonge son observation tr\u00e8s attentive de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, telle qu\u2019elle est, tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8tement. Son style demeure clair, sans fioritures inutiles, les phrases courtes expriment les pens\u00e9es et les actes des personnages dans un vocabulaire simple et une syntaxe vari\u00e9e ; les digressions sont rares et mesur\u00e9es, d\u00e9barrass\u00e9es des d\u00e9bordements lyriques (ou pornographiques) de certains \u00e9crits bien ant\u00e9rieurs.Sur bien des points \u00e9voqu\u00e9s ci-dessus, An\u00e9antir se situe dans la suite des pr\u00e9occupations abord\u00e9es dans La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00eele paru en 2005 ou de La carte et le territoire de 2010. Cette continuit\u00e9 qualifie la singularit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur dans le paysage \u00e9ditorial de ce d\u00e9but XXIe si\u00e8cle. Cependant la tonalit\u00e9 plus grave de ce dernier ouvrage porte la marque de la maturit\u00e9 de l\u2019homme.Jean-Pierre Bouguier \u2013 mai 2022", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4469789559", "review_id": "4469789559", "date": "Feb 07, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "St\u00e9phane", "user_url": "/user/show/75814627-st-phane", "text": "Tr\u00e8s bon livre avec une certaine maturit\u00e9", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4845323506", "review_id": "4845323506", "date": "Jul 13, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Mike Keirsbilck", "user_url": "/user/show/9024792-mike-keirsbilck", "text": "Verassende wending in het oeuvre.

J\u2019aim\u00e9 bien ce roman.\u00ab Arriv\u00e9s au point culminant de la roche, ils consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent le paysage de coteaux, de prairies, de for\u00eats et de vignes qui s\u2019\u00e9tendait \u00e0 leurs pieds. \u00ab Alors c\u2019est \u00e7a, la France...\u00bb dit-elle apr\u00e8s un long moment. \u00ab Oui... r\u00e9pondit-il, enfin oui, \u00e7a y ressemble pas mal. \u00bb\u00ab Aur\u00e9lien eut l\u2019impression qu\u2019ils tombaient l\u2019un vers l\u2019autre en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019ils se rapprochaient du sommet. Est-ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait cela, l\u2019amour ? Si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, c\u2019\u00e9tait une chose bizarre, et paradoxalement facile ; c\u2019\u00e9tait une chose, en tout cas, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais connue. (\u2026) Une fois nu il se rallongea \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s, elle sentait merveilleusement bon aussi, il enfouit la t\u00eate entre ses seins. Au bout d\u2019une \u00e0 deux minutes elle d\u00e9cida de prendre les choses en main, d\u00e9posa des baisers sur sa poitrine et sur son ventre, puis le prit dans sa bouche, les choses se d\u00e9roul\u00e8rent ensuite avec une facilit\u00e9 d\u00e9concertante, il ne savait pas du tout que la sexualit\u00e9 pouvait se passer avec cette simplicit\u00e9, cette douceur, \u00e7a ne ressemblait pas du tout \u00e0 ses anciens rapports avec Indy, pas davantage aux quelques pornos qu\u2019il avait pu voir sur Internet, peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 quelques descriptions qu\u2019il avait lues dans des livres mais au fond pas tellement non plus, c\u2019\u00e9tait un autre monde, dans lequel il plongea compl\u00e8tement et il avait oubli\u00e9 beaucoup de choses, presque tout en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il entendit frapper \u00e0 sa porte et la voix de C\u00e9cile lui annoncer que le d\u00eener \u00e9tait pr\u00eat. \u00bb\u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait curieux, sa m\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une \u00e9pouse exceptionnelle, pas sp\u00e9cialement tendre ni aimante, pas non plus tr\u00e8s attach\u00e9e \u00e0 son foyer - elle avait, si l\u2019on y songeait, pas mal de points communs avec la m\u00e8re de Prudence, \u00e0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle venait plut\u00f4t de la petite bourgeoisie. Il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019impression, dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, que leur amour ait vraiment r\u00e9sist\u00e9 au temps ; et pourtant ils avaient continu\u00e9, ils avaient pass\u00e9 leur vie ensemble, \u00e9lev\u00e9 des enfants, ils avaient pass\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin, et apr\u00e8s la mort de la femme le mari n\u2019avait plus su comment vivre, il n\u2019avait simplement pas su continuer. Dans le cas du p\u00e8re de Prudence c\u2019\u00e9tait pire, il avait s il s\u2019en souvenait bien un peu plus de quatre-vingts ans, il d\u00e9butait une maladie de Parkinson, enfin pour lui c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment game over. \u00bb\u00ab \u00c7a n\u2019aurait aucun sens de prier dans ton cas, hurla-t-elle, ce serait presque un blasph\u00e8me, la pri\u00e8re ne peut avoir aucun effet sur toi parce qu\u2019au fond tu n\u2019as pas envie de vivre. La vie est un don de Dieu, et Dieu t\u2019aidera si tu t\u2019aides toi-m\u00eame, mais si tu refuses le don de Dieu il ne peut plus rien pour toi, et au fond tu n\u2019as m\u00eame pas le droit de le refuser, tu t\u2019imagines peut-\u00eatre que ta vie t\u2019appartient mais c\u2019est faux, ta vie appartient \u00e0 ceux qui t\u2019aiment, tu appartiens \u00e0 Prudence d\u2019abord, mais aussi un peu \u00e0 moi, et peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 d\u2019autres gens que je ne connais pas, tu appartiens aux autres, m\u00eame si tu ne le sais pas. \u00bb\u00ab M\u00eame des dirigeants aussi autoritaires et d\u00e9termin\u00e9s que le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle s\u2019\u00e9taient montr\u00e9s impuissants \u00e0 s\u2019opposer au sens de l\u2019histoire, l\u2019Europe dans sa totalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait devenue une province lointaine, vieillissante, d\u00e9pressive et l\u00e9g\u00e8rement ridicule des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique. Le destin de la France, malgr\u00e9 les pittoresques fanfaronnades du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, avait-il r\u00e9ellement diff\u00e9r\u00e9 de celui des autres pays d\u2019Europe occidentale ? \u00bb\u00ab Il se tut, ils m\u00e9dit\u00e8rent un instant sur cette perspective. Martin-Renaud, perdu dans une contemplation angoiss\u00e9e du paysage futuriste de m\u00e9tal et de verre qui s\u2019\u00e9tendait derri\u00e8re sa baie vitr\u00e9e, songeait que son subordonn\u00e9 avait raison : les moyens d\u2019attaque progressaient bien plus vite que les moyens de d\u00e9fense ; l\u2019ordre et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du monde allaient devenir de plus en plus difficiles \u00e0 assurer. (\u2026) il fallait qu\u2019il se couche et qu\u2019il essaie de dormir, peut-\u00eatre est-ce que du saut \u00e0 ski ferait l\u2019affaire - le pire \u00e9tait que si l\u2019objectif des terroristes \u00e9tait d\u2019an\u00e9antir le monde tel qu\u2019il le connaissait, d\u2019an\u00e9antir le monde moderne, il ne pouvait pas leur donner tout \u00e0 fait tort. \u00bb", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4462318619", "review_id": "4462318619", "date": "Apr 12, 2022", "rating": 5, "user_name": "David Pires", "user_url": "/user/show/130169080-david-pires", "text": "I just hope it isn\u2019t his last one.

Per me \u00e8 stato un bel romanzo, ma ho numerose riserve.Innanzitutto, il romanzo si concentra su dinamiche familiari e coniugali. Analizza la societ\u00e0 occidentale moderna evidanziandone il nichilismo e l'arrivismo, ma soprattutto la solitudine e la parcellizzazione delle persone che la compongono. I personaggi del libro trovano un antidoto al nichilismo, all'assurdo e alla solitudine nell'amore familiare e coniugale. Da questo punto di vista, \u00e8 un romanzo caldo e luminoso: i personaggi si fanno forza a vicenda e si stringono l'uno all'altro, trovando nell'amore uno dei motivi principali che rende la vita degna di essere vissuta. Un altro tema importante \u00e8 quello spirituale: il sentimento religioso viene offerto come ulteriore antidoto al materialismo soffocante del mondo contemporaneo, e trovo che questo aspetto venga gestito molto bene e senza troppo pregiudizi. Il protagonista \u00e8 un agnostico e non ha idee religiose ben delineate: ci\u00f2 gli permette di riflettere su varie tradizioni differenti e di tratteggiare un ritratto dell'anelito e del bisogno spirituale dell'essere umano, esperienze che nonostante tutto riescono a sottrarsi alle istanze materialistiche contemporanee. In altre parole il libro, attraverso i suoi personaggi, cerca di offrire un rimedio al disfacimento della societ\u00e0 occidentale (percorsa da un profondo sentimento di svuotamento di senso e matoriata da incessanti divorzi, litigi per eredit\u00e0, disgregazioni familiari, ossessione per la performance lavorativa e per il potere) ripiegando su \"valori tradizionali\", e cio\u00e8 la famiglia e la spiritualit\u00e0, che per l'autore appaiono insostituibili non solo per garantire l'equilibrio e la felicit\u00e0 individuali ma anche per salvaguardare la compattezza del tessuto sociale nel suo insieme, e cio\u00e8 per opporre l'ordine al caos. Queste sono posizioni che condivido e rispetto, e va riconosciuto il merito a Houellebecq di essere stato un buon interprete delle tendenze anti - nichilistiche che stanno riemergendo nella societ\u00e0 e che spingono gli esseri umani ad adoperarsi in una rinnovata ricerca di senso emancipata dal materialismo pi\u00f9 asettico e dal relativismo assoluto, gli \"ospiti inquietanti\" che abbiamo ereditato dalle generazioni precedenti. Bene ma non benissimo: se gli intenti sembrano essere nobili non sempre la loro applicazione mi \u00e8 apparsa altrettanto brillante. Cito un passo dal libro che mi ha fatto storcere il naso: \"l'entit\u00e0 formata da una coppia, e pi\u00f9 precisamente una coppia eterosessuale, resta la principale possibilit\u00e0 pratica di manifestazione dell'amore\", che nel 2022 appare un pensiero per lo meno atavico se non imbarazzante e bigotto.Ora, la frase pu\u00f2 prestarsi a pi\u00f9 letture: infatti possiamo facilmente leggerci la constatazione del fatto che il clima di odio e discriminazione contro la comunit\u00e0 queer non favorisce nei suoi componenti lo sviluppo di quell'equilibrio psicologico fondamentale per imparare ad amare in maniera sana. In realt\u00e0 per\u00f2 mi ricorda da vicino un passo dell'Arte di amare di Erich Fromm in cui l'autore sostiene che gli omosessuali non siano capaci di imparare ad amare in maniera sana, \"vera\", perch\u00e9 patologicamente immaturi, e quindi destinati a vivere rapporti fondati sulla passione, sull'o ossessione e sull'identificazione narcisistica, ma non sull'amore. Per inciso, il sospetto che l'autore abbia inserito nel romanzo frasi volutamente controverse per suscitare scalpore e far parlare di s\u00e9 c'\u00e8, ma se un autore ha bisogno di ricorrere a questi espedienti molto facilmente perde gran parte della sua credibilit\u00e0 ai miei occhi (ma fortunatamente il mio giudizio non conta niente nella grande economia delle cose).  In generale, il quadro che emerge del romanzo \u00e8 quello di una visione del mondo tradizionale, fortemente eteronormativa, patriarcale e anche, pi\u00f9 o meno velatamente, misogina. Aleggia nel romanzo il quesito su cosa significhi essere uomini ed essere donne, e il fratello pi\u00f9 giovane del protagonista, Aureli\u00e9n, semplicemente non ce la fa, non riesce a capire come essere un uomo, e si ammazza. Perch\u00e9? Le ragioni sono molteplici, ma il romanzo sembra voler suggerire che molti dei suoi problemi psicologici affondano le loro radici nel padre assente e nella madre allontanatasi dal focolare domestico per perseguire le sue (pretenziose) velleit\u00e0 artistiche. Aureliene a 13 anni ha concesso una sega al deliziato omosessuale del palazzo, durante l'adolescenza ha avuto poche esperienze con le donne finch\u00e9 non ha trovato e sposato una donna perfida e arrivista che lo odia e il cui interesse \u00e8 unicamente quello di sottometterlo in tutti gli aspetti della sua vita. Il fatto che Aureli\u00e9n decida di ammazzarsi non pu\u00f2 che apparirmi come una punizione per il fatto di non essere stato abbastanza solido, maturo, \"maschio\", per affrontare la vita, tanto pi\u00f9 perch\u00e9 le prime descrizioni che ci vengono offerte del personaggio sono quelle di un uomo che ha rinnegato l'eredit\u00e0 spirituale e lavorativa del padre per costruirsi una personalit\u00e0 modellata in tutto e per tutto su quella della madre. Anche il ritratto che emerge delle donne del romanzo non \u00e8 splendido:- La madre del protagonista ha poco spazio narrativo ma le poche sequenze dedicatele si concentrano soprattutto sul fatto che nell'ultimo periodo della sua vita ha preferito allontanarsi dalla famiglia per concentrarsi sulle sue ambizioni artistiche, e ci\u00f2 si \u00e8 ripercosso negativamente sul rapporto coi figli, per i quali diventa quasi un'estranea- Cecile \u00e8 un personaggio femminile forte e positivo, ma questa forza deriva dal contegno verginale di una casalinga fervente cristiana - La moglie di Aureliene \u00e8 un personaggio bidimensionale e macchiettistico caratterizzato soltanto da cieca ambizione, volont\u00e0 di prevaricazione sull'uomo e fama di denaro e prestigio sociale- Di Prudence, sebbene occupi una posizione lavorativa importante, al di l\u00e0 del suo interesse per la Wiccan e la reincarnazione, non ci viene offerto un ritratto psicologico dettagliato, e nell'ultima parte del libro si insiste fino alla nausea sul suo culo, i suoi shorts, e il cazzo di Paul che (sorprendente! Contro ogni aspettativa!!! Che potenza maschile, Paul, complimenti!!!), continua a farsi durissimo anche dopo cicli debilitanti di radio e chemioterapia. Paragrafo a parte merita la sottotrama da romanzo di spionaggio, che sebbene inizialmente sembri avvincente e promettente alla fine si risolve in un muro di fumo e si rivela come un riempitivo ingegnoso ma inconcludente. L'intento dell'autore potrebbe essere stato quello di elaborare una parodia del genere o comunque di adoperarsi in un tentativo di decostruzione metanarrativa, ma per me \u00e8 semplicemente un tentativo non riuscito o comunque non di mio gradimento. Ci sono diverse opere che riescono a intecciare una dimensione personale e intima a una pi\u00f9 thriller e di spionaggio (vedi Mr. Robot di Sam Esmail, sotto certi aspetti simile al romanzo romanzo per quanto riguarda la tematica dell'hacking), e questa, a dispetto delle promesse iniziali, non ce la fa; posso capire l'intento parodistico ma l'idea di costruire una trama solo per 3/4 non mi sembra genialit\u00e0 narritiva ma pigrizia.In definitiva, sono riuscito ad affezionarmi a quasi tutti i personaggi, ho adorato le numerosissime sequenze descrittive dei viaggi in auto e in treno e ho apprezzato tantissimo il calore familiare che trasuda dalle pagine del libro. Nonostante ci\u00f2, sebbene io apprezzi genuinamente l'intento anti - entopico e anti - nichilista che permea l'opera, devo necessariamente bocciare la visione del mondo ancora maschilista e eteronormativa che emerge dalle pagine del libro. L'autore ha un figlio che dovrebbe avere pi\u00f9 o meno l'et\u00e0 di Paul, per cui l'opera potrebbe venire idealmente intesa come un' \"eredit\u00e0\" di valori e ideali da lasciare al figlio (e conseguentemente a noi lettori) per aiutarlo a orientarsi nella vita. Molte di queste idee per\u00f2 sanno di vecchio, di stantio, e non trovano un valore concreto nella societ\u00e0 moderna, non trovano una reale applicabilit\u00e0 per me uomo di 23 anni. Altre - l'amore per la famiglia e per il partner, una forma di spiritualit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 intima ed emancipata dalle forme preconfezionate - sono invece validissime e, per me, valgono l'opera.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4807259550", "review_id": "4807259550", "date": "Jun 26, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Javier", "user_url": "/user/show/20951046-javier", "text": "Un Houellebecq sorprendente.

An\u00e9antir, e lembrei-me que h\u00e1 tr\u00eas anos, quando li o anterior \u201cS\u00e9rotonine\u201d, fiz aqui uma cr\u00f3nica sobre o livro\u2026 Agora, sinto que n\u00e3o posso deixar de falar tamb\u00e9m sobre este novo romance, at\u00e9 porque este, tal como os outros, \u00e9 um testemunho implac\u00e1vel nos nossos tempos, sendo que h\u00e1 aqui todo um conjunto de reflex\u00f5es interessantes sobre o fim - o fim da civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o que conhecemos, por um lado, e o fim da vida, por outro. Temas que parecem obcecar o autor, mas que neste livro ele decide levar ainda mais longe.H\u00e1 uma cada vez maior e mais radical obsess\u00e3o com o fim que parece acompanhar a pr\u00f3pria degrada\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica do autor, que acompanhamos sempre que aparece nas agora cada vez mais raras entrevistas.Este \u00e9 um livro pesado, tanto no sentido figurado, como no sentido literal do termo. Al\u00e9m de ser o maior que Houellebecq alguma vez escreveu, com mais de 700 p\u00e1ginas, desta vez a Flammarion optou por uma capa dura, rara no mundo da edi\u00e7\u00e3o em Fran\u00e7a, o que d\u00e1 a este livro um peso ainda maior, peso que sentimos tanto a transport\u00e1-lo como a l\u00ea-lo.No entanto, tal como todos os anteriores, l\u00ea-se de um f\u00f4lego, Houellebecq nunca me desilude.H\u00e1 muitos autores, tanto lus\u00f3fonos como franc\u00f3fonos, como de outras l\u00ednguas e origens, que gosto de ler com regularidade.

Dabei ereignen sich in verschiedenen Lebensbereichen mehr oder weniger aussergew\u00f6hnliche Dinge:- Beruf: Die Welt (bzw. insbesondere Europa und Frankreich) erlebt verschiedene Terroranschl\u00e4ge, welche technologisch, logistisch und in ihrer Ausf\u00fchrung \u00e4usserst professionel erfolgen. Die Motive und Gesinnung der Verantwortlichen sind nur schwer nachvollziehbar. Zugleich findet in Frankreich die Pr\u00e4sidentenwahl statt.- Familie: Pauls Vater erleidet einen Schlaganfall, f\u00e4llt ins Koma, erwacht, verbleibt jedoch in einem Wachkoma. Paul und seine Frau Prudence n\u00e4hern sich einander langsam wieder an. Gemeinsam mit seinen Geschwistern entf\u00fchrt bzw. befreit Paul seinen Vater aus dem Pflegeheim, und bringt ihn nach Hause. Kurz darauf begeht Pauls Bruder Selbstmord. Prudences Mutter verstirbt. Zuletzt erkrankt Paul an Mundkrebs und wird sterben (das Buch endet rund 1 Monat davor).2) Was sagt das Buch?Houellebecq \u00e4ussert Kritik am franz\u00f6sischen Pflegesystem, insbesondere an der Behandlung der alten Menschen. Stellenweise finden sich weitere gesellschaftskritische, z.T. auch religionskritische Passagen. Weiter wird dargelegt, wie unterschiedliche Menschen mit unterschiedlichen Krankheiten umgehen. Der Erz\u00e4hlstrang der Terroranschl\u00e4ge zeigt rudiment\u00e4r auf, wozu eine gut organisierte Gruppe mit gen\u00fcgend finanziellen Mitteln und technologischem Wissen in der heutigen Welt f\u00e4hig sein k\u00f6nnte.3) Ist das, was im Buch steht wahr \u2013 Insgesamt oder zum Teil?Die gesellschaftliche Kritik, insbesondere jene betreffend Wertsch\u00e4tzung und Umgang mit alten Menschen, trifft teilweise sicherlich zu (Wirtschaftlichkeit/Rationalisierung auf Kosten der Menschlichkeit/w\u00fcrdevollen Behandlung). Die Schilderungen der Krankheiten scheinen gut recherchiert. Die Geschehnisse, welche sich in Pauls Umfeld ereignen, sind durchaus realistisch, wenngleich die H\u00e4ufung s\u00e4mtlicher \u201eSchicksalsschl\u00e4ge\u201c innert einer so kurzen Zeitspanne statistisch wohl unwahrscheinlich sein d\u00fcrfte.4) KritikDie sprachlichen F\u00e4higkeiten Houellebecqs sind hervorzuheben. Auch wenn stellenweise lange, mehrfach verschachtelte und nicht einfach lesbare S\u00e4tze konstruiert werden, wird dies durch die Wahl treffender W\u00f6rter kompensiert. Der Autor versteht es, seine Gedankeng\u00e4nge pr\u00e4zis (und vereinzelt durchaus suffisant) zu Papier zu bringen. Auch die philosophischen/politischen/historischen Ausf\u00fchrungen (Abschweifungen?) sind gr\u00f6sstenteils interessant geschrieben und regten mich das ein oder andere Mal zum Nachdenken und weitergehender Online-Recherche an.Dieser letzte Punkt ist indessen zugleich ein negativer Kritikpunkt: Die vorgenannten Abschweifungen fielen z.T. etwas gar langatmig und mitunter skurril aus. Skurril waren auch die mehrmals beschriebenen Tr\u00e4ume von Paul, wobei sich mir bis zum Schluss nicht erschlossen hat, welche Relevanz diese aufweisen. Meines Erachtens reine Seitenf\u00fcller ohne Mehrwert, auf welche der Autor h\u00e4tte verzichten k\u00f6nnen.Auch die h\u00e4ufigen, teilweise willk\u00fcrlich verstreuten, sexuellen Ausf\u00fchrungen erschienen deplatziert.Was die Geschichte an sich betrifft, handelt es sich, wie eingangs erw\u00e4hnt, im Prinzip um eine Beschreibung aus Pauls Leben. Eine wirkliche \u201eStory\u201c ist nur im Ansatz vorhanden. Insbesondere der Handlungsstrang der terroristischen Anschl\u00e4ge wurde nur rudiment\u00e4r eingewebt. Dieser Handlungsstrang h\u00e4tte \u2013 konsequent weiterverfolgt \u2013 Stoff f\u00fcr ein eigenes Buch geboten. Insgesamt wirkt das Buch etwas \u201emit Handlungsstr\u00e4ngen \u00fcberladen\u201c, wobei einige davon pl\u00f6tzlich einfach wieder fallen gelassen werden.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_id": "61079426-aniquilaci-n", "book_title": "Aniquilaci\u00f3n", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4494920030", "review_id": "4494920030", "date": "Feb 13, 2022", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Along the Seine", "user_url": "/user/show/118246223-along-the-seine", "text": "Le protagoniste d'\u00ab An\u00e9antir \u00bb coche toutes les cases d\u2019un protagoniste houellebecqien. Il s\u2019agit bien d\u2019un homme blanc, la quarantaine, privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 et en plein crise personnelle. Vers quel monde conduit-il le lecteur ? Dans le roman, nous y trouvons de la grande politique, des petites vies, des maladies, de l'amour, des relations dysfonctionnelles, des femmes fortes et des hommes faibles. Par ailleurs, j'ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le fait qu'il y ait des personnages f\u00e9minin plut\u00f4t positifs, m\u00eame si ces femmes sont souvent peintes avec des touches tr\u00e8s sarcastiques et ironiques de l'auteur.Dans \u00ab An\u00e9antir \u00bb, un roman de m\u0153urs se m\u00eale au roman d'investigation et \u00e0 la romance. Tout est cousu ensemble avec des fils invisibles et dans un superbe atelier litt\u00e9raire.Oui, le livre est impressionnant et plus il y a de pages lues, plus on a envie de continuer.Je reconnais que si pendant un quart du livre, j'avais pass\u00e9 d'excellents moments \u00e0 savourer les jeux de mots et la virtuosit\u00e9 de la langue, l'intrigue elle-m\u00eame me semblait un peu superflue. Je suis donc rest\u00e9e en dehors de l'histoire. Toutefois, au bout d\u2019environ 200 pages, la distance qui me prot\u00e9geait de la plume de Houellebecq, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'\u00e9vaporer. Je me suis mise \u00e0 croire les personnages et \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des mots. Que tout ce que j\u2019\u00e9tais en train de lire, \u00e9tait r\u00e9el. Que dans le monde qu'il d\u00e9crit, l'amour, l'amiti\u00e9, une v\u00e9ritable \u00e9thique professionnelle, la sagesse et l'altruisme, que tout cela existait, sans ast\u00e9risque ni note de bas de page. En effet, beaucoup de belles choses se passent entre les protagonistes. Dans un sens, c'est un bon monde.J'admire ce roman davantage pour la description des relations dans la fratrie. Pour la description des relations familiales en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. C'est la source du plus grand espoir, m\u00eame si, oui, je l'admets, c'est plut\u00f4t un espoir avort\u00e9 : une v\u00e9ritable communication avec le p\u00e8re ne devient possible que lorsqu'il n'est plus en mesure de s\u2019exprimer. L'amour et l'attention mutuelle \u00e9veill\u00e9s dans la fratrie, sont trop timides pour emp\u00eacher une trag\u00e9die.Et bien s\u00fbr, ce n\u2019est pas par hasard. Houellebecq connait son m\u00e9tier. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir conclu un pacte avec le lecteur que des coups peuvent \u00eatre dispos\u00e9s. Sans pr\u00e9venir. Ils font mal.N\u00e9anmoins, c\u2019est bien l'existence de ces grands quantificateurs qui permet au lecteur de perdurer, un peu comme dans un film hollywoodien plein de pathos.

And the second is about the main characters' work with the minister of finance, an upcoming election and a series of cyber attacks.The book is long, and full of unnecessary details, characters and scenes, which only interfere with the book core message - the battle against sickness and death, told in a factual, almost merciless manner. Most of the book follows Paul Raison's father's sickness, but by the end of the book Paul himself gets cancer. This plot development is told by a series of meetings with various doctors, and it is a realistic, sad and meaningful description of death. It is hard not to think of your own death by reading those pages, a chilling experience. This part of this book has a strong social and philosophical message - about the way society treats old people, economically and socially, about what is important in life, and about the general feeling of death, ending and meaninglessness in the west.This strong plot gets constantly interfered by unnecessary characters and plots - a myogenic portrait of Paul brother\u2019s wife, an obvious satire on modern election, a cyber attack that leads to nowhere. There is so much to delete and edit, that it significantly hurts the novel.I think most interesting in this novel, after reading all of his precious ones, are the way he looks at sex and realtionship. The unfulfilled sex drive was on of the main points, theoreticly and emotionaly, in Houellebecq previous novels. In this novel, the sex drive is gone, and in contrast to Philip Roth later novels, is hardly missed. The relationship with his wife, and the love he gets from her, become Paul's most important thing, he\u2019s reason to live and comfort by dying.

The friendship with the minister, the presidential election. Interspersed with many witty and funny elaborations about God(s), the world and The Matrix (and some boring deam sequences). While all the cynism and nihilsm is still there, I was astonished to see a love story emerging! In an unexpected twist, Prudence and Paul heal their marriage, even their sex gets a romantic touch.

O you, my help, come quickly to my aid! Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog.\u201d-\tPsalm 22:19-20. Everything about Don Winslow\u2019s The Power of the Dog feels familiar. As I read it, pop culture artifacts as different as Mario Puzo\u2019s The Godfather, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Traffic, and the techno-thrillers of Tom Clancy popped into my head. The dramatis personae is almost a list of archetypes: the hard-charging, straight-edged DEA agent; the hard-charging agent's charmless boss; and the urbane drug lord who gradually gets his hands dirtier and dirtier. This is a novel where you can see all the moving parts, but it\u2019s constructed so well, that it never matters. From page one, you are reading downhill.The Power of a the Dog is a sweeping, 542-page epic of the drug trade. It tells a fictional story that is framed by real life events. It begins in 1975, with a close-in look at the infamous Operation Condor, and ends in 2004, when the War on Drugs has taken on a new, post-9/11 look. In between\u2026some very bad things happen. Trying to describe the plot is an unnecessary exercise that I won\u2019t attempt except at the most macro level. The backbone of the narrative is the struggle between Art Keller, the straight-edged DEA agent I mentioned above, and Adan Barrera, the Michael Corleone of the Mexican Cartels. Keller is obsessed with bringing down Adan\u2019s organization, El Federaci\u00f3n. This simple motive is the one constant in an otherwise sprawling book, which includes characters like Sean Callan, an Irish hitman with a load of guilt (because he\u2019s Catholic, duh!); Nora, a high-class hooker with a heart of gold (naturally); a mobster nicknamed Peaches (because he likes peaches); an incorruptible priest named Father Parada, who reminds me of the \u201ccool\u201d young Jesuits I knew in college (he smokes and he curses!); and Ramos, the last good cop in Mexico, who has a preternatural ability to find the bad guys (he chews an unlit cigar, so you know he\u2019s badass). All these are stock types. Winslow tries to develop them, but they never leap off the page as three-dimensional humans. Keller, for instance, is half-Mexican, comes from barrios, and is suitably tortured by his past actions and mistakes. Despite this, his unbending rectitude makes him the least interesting star in the constellation. He is just one more haunted cop in the litany of fiction\u2019s haunted cops. Many of these people die, some quite horribly. Their deaths affected me on an intellectual level (plot twist!), but never an emotional one. They were just names, nicknames, and affectations, like Tarantino creations. Cool, yes. Memorable, yes. Psychologically and emotionally realized, not quite. (One character, who I will not name, plays a long con that is only believable if you do not imagine these people having a life outside the page). Mentioning this is almost beside the point. Once you start reading, you\u2019re going to finish. Pointing out clich\u00e9s in the characters is like bemoaning the view from the top of a roller coaster. What matters is how all these characters interact, use each other, con each other, hurt each other. Winslow writes at a very high level. There are incredible set pieces. A mob hit. A shootout in the streets. A raid by drug enforcement agents. Even the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. The Power of the Dog is packed with memorable scenes. It is also surprisingly powerful. In his prologue, Winslow drops us into his story with the image of a dead child. No explanation, no context. Hundreds of pages later, he\u2019ll circle back to this scene, and the meaning he develops by finally placing it within the framework of the story is ingenious. Apart from the frenetic action, Winslow also takes care to show us the big picture of the drug trade. He bounces from location to location to show us the entire pipeline. We move from Central American jungles to Mexico City to U.S.-Mexican border crossings to New York City. (This is referred to in the novel as the Mexican Trampoline). He shows you the interaction between Mexican organized crime, and American organized crime (here focusing on the Mafia, rather than street gangs), along with the complicity of the Mexican government and the meddling, regime-destabilizing antics of the U.S. government. The Power of the Dog manages to seamlessly transition between scope and intimacy, to show us both the bigger picture, and to give us a gritty feel for the smaller details. I read this book right around the time my brother-in-law died. It\u2019s not what I would\u2019ve chosen (filled with sadness, death, and hopelessness), but it was at hand. It\u2019s a testament to Winslow\u2019s storytelling abilities that it captured and held my attention during an impossible time. That said, this is not escapist fiction. It is far too brutal. This is one of the most graphic books I\u2019ve ever read, and that\u2019s saying something, since my prurient interest leads me to seek these things out. There is a heavy quotient of murder and torture, all described in great detail. But Winslow is not working in the tradition of grand guignol. He is not stylizing the violence. He does not make it so over-the-top as to render the bloodshed harmless. To the contrary, the things Winslow describes occur far too frequently on the U.S.-Mexican border, where cartels kidnap and decapitate to send their messages.(I cannot forget an image I once saw posted by the New York Times, of two consular workers murdered in their car in Ciudad Juarez. The picture showed the front of the car, the windshield dappled with gunshot holes. There is a man and woman inside - a husband and wife - both leaning towards the passenger side door, still buckled into their seats. Both are covered in blood. The woman was pregnant. Their daughter in the backseat was unhurt. Fiction cannot devise horror to surpass the realities of this sad world). The Power of the Dog is a relentless indictment of the \u201cWar of Drugs.\u201d Sometimes this is effective, as when Winslow is showing us the mistakes as they\u2019re made. At other times, when Keller gets on his high-horse, it can be like a screed. Interestingly, Winslow\u2019s critique on American drug policy seems to focus on suppression and interdiction. Keller is constantly in conflict with timid bureaucrats who won\u2019t go far enough to get the bad guys; or with a Federal Government that is willing to turn a blind eye to inter-cartel housecleaning, as long as it decreases the gross amount of product coming across the border. Winslow doesn\u2019t seem to be looking for a paradigm change; instead, he wants interdiction done better. The reason I find this interesting is that focus on the supply side is a fool\u2019s game. You are never going to \u201cwin\u201d by going after the cartels, and especially not after their pawns. Every victory over a supplier simply ups the price, making the risk of drug-running even more attractive. The focus has to be on the demand side of the equation. It means focusing on drug treatment and addiction north of the Rio Grande. The actual end-result of drug smuggling \u2013 the experience of the user \u2013 is never mentioned in The Power of the Dog. This is rather glaring in a novel that encompasses just about everything else. Of course, this \u201csolution\u201d to the drug problem is far easier said than done. I work with drug users. There might not be anything on earth quite as frustrating. Getting people clean is a long, expensive, intensive, expensive, difficult, and expensive process that embodies the notion of one step forward, two (or three, or four) steps back. Did I mention it is expensive? It certainly doesn\u2019t make for sexy fiction, or good public relations visuals. Likely, a massive demand-side resolution will never be implemented. Anyway, that\u2019s beside the point. This is a great work of fiction.

I got about 50 pages in and knew that I should have gotten around to this earlier and was peeved at myself for wasting time this year on more disappointing reads. This is the type of book that doesn't come around too often. A book that finds the perfect balance between it's attention to detail and research, it's sensitivity to character, and it's great structure, all wrapped up in passionate prose. Imagine a mix of Traffic, Sicario, and Narcos, with elements of The Godfather and then multiply it by 3, then you'll get a sense of what to expect from The Power of the Dog, which details an epic battle during America's unwinnable War on Drugs, a 30-year battle between DEA agent Art Keller and Mexican cartel lord Ad\u00e1n Barrera, who were once good buddies. We witness the rise of both men within their respective ranks, and as the feud strengthens, they struggle to stay one step ahead of the other, dragging others into the trenches with them, into a war that neither side can truly win. This was one of the longest books I read this year, but it felt like I sped through reading it. It was endlessly engaging and one of the most compulsively readable books for me this year. Every character was fascinating and I found myself rooting for all of them, especially Art Keller and his unwavering drive to bring down the Barreras, and Sean Callan, a young New Yorker whose fateful decision to protect his buddy leads him into a life of violence where he faces a constant struggle to keep his morals. And it's all very tragic, because all of this violence and death is part of a silly \"War\" on Drugs where the priorities and the objectives have been skewed big time, a war that should've ended a long time ago.You know those addictive tv shows that you can't help but binge-watch on Netflix, Prime, or HBONow all weekend?

I\u2019d put it at #3 after Savages and The Winter of Frankie Machine. However, considering that Winslow has written over a dozen books and for my money is one of the best and most underrated guys working in crime fiction today, getting a bronze medal is pretty damn good.Running from the mid-1970s until the turn of the century, Winslow\u2019s historical fiction illustrates the difference between the stated public policy of America\u2019s drug war against the covert backing of the drug trade to keep communism out of Central and South America.Art Keller is a former CIA agent who got disgusted with running assassination missions in Vietnam and jumped to the newly formed Drug Enforcement Agency where he thought he might be able to do some good. Art gets assigned to Mexico where he meets the Barrera family who feeds him the intel to destroy most of the existing heroin trade and poppy fields. Art later learns that the Barreras used him to eliminate the competition and give them the opportunity to set up an organization that will get rich running cocaine from South America into the United States.Blood gets spilled and Art\u2019s feud with the Barreras gets personal, but Art\u2019s attempt to legally break up the Mexican pipeline are thwarted by his own government\u2019s secret programs to fund anti-communist efforts in South America by allowing or enabling the trade to flourish as the crack epidemic hits inner cites while Nancy Reagan tells kids to Just Say No!Art\u2019s obsession and the war with the Barreras takes a heavy toll on everyone involved like a respected priest, a smart call girl, and a Mafia hit man from New York.This reminds me a bit of Elroy\u2019s American Tabloid with Winslow using a group of fictional characters tearing themselves to bits on the sharp hidden edges of history, and the style is even a bit similar. Winslow also does a great job of using the story to create a broader theme about the ultimate futility and hypocrisy of the drug war.My only complaint is that the end of the book seems a bit less ambitious and kind of a let down compared to the build up. It\u2019s like something you\u2019d see in a Hollywood movie, but this is still an epic crime story written in a unique style by one of my favorites.**Update 7/17/2015 - Don Winslow went on to make this a trilogy.

I spent most of the time sitting poolside, sipping on drinks with neon colors and umbrellas floating in the ice. I rode the choppy waves of the pacific ocean on a jet ski and an atv along the sandy beach while the sun was setting. I haven\u2019t been to South America, but when I think of South America, the same associations come to mind. I think about dancing in the streets during Carnival in Brazil and looking down on the rest of civilization at Machu Picchu in Peru. I was well aware of the drug problem in the United States. Working in the inner city, I\u2019ve seen the effects of drugs being so readily available. What I wasn\u2019t aware of was how the drugs made it to the U.S. or the people that are involved in getting them here. Don Winslow gave me a swift kick in the ass, woke me up from vacation, and pulled back the curtain on the dark and seedy side of Mexico and South America. Part historical fiction, part noir, the story follows a slew of characters from the 1970\u2019s to the 2000\u2019s, highlighting the different ways that people get involved in the war on drugs on both the law enforcement side and the drug trafficking side. The main character is Art Keller. Art is an idealistic CIA agent that wants to get the bad taste out of his mouth from his part in the farce that was Vietnam. He wants to do something important for his country. So he trades in one acronym for another and joins the DEA. The foil to Keller is the Barerra family, who rise to the top in the race to cartel supremacy in Mexico. Some other characters that get involved are a high end call girl, a priest, an irish mobster, and the enemies made by the Barerra family. The book is well researched and includes characters that were loosely based off of real life players in the war on drugs. The key to the book for me was Art Keller\u2019s character arc. He starts the book with the naive idealism that everyone who wants to change the world possesses. But Art can\u2019t outsmart or gain ground on the absurdity that is the war on drugs. The drug trade as it is now, thrives because drugs are illegal. The only people that sell and distribute drugs are criminals. This attracts the most violent and corrupt criminals in a race to the top of the cartel food chain. The people put in a position to try and stop these criminals have to deal with the reality of the situation. They have two options when faced with an ultimatum by cartels. They can chose to try and fight them and get tortured and murdered or get paid to keep their mouth shut and keep the peace. In the end, Keller finds himself on the losing end of a game that he realizes isn\u2019t winnable and is left wondering if the end justifies the means.", "num_likes": 79, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4676983671", "review_id": "4676983671", "date": "Apr 25, 2022", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Overhaul", "user_url": "/user/show/119942639-overhaul", "text": "La guerra contra los narcos al desnudo.

Cuenta una historia ficticia que est\u00e1 enmarcada por hechos de la vida real. Comienza en 1975, con una mirada cercana a la afamada Operaci\u00f3n C\u00f3ndor, y termina en 2004, justo en el momento en el que la guerra contra las drogas se ha moldeado en un nuevo aspecto posterior al 11 de septiembre. En medio de todo eso suceden algunas cosas, muy, muy malas.Documentaci\u00f3n de 10 llevada con realismo, y da miedo, pues la realidad supera a la ficci\u00f3n y en la ambici\u00f3n, crueldad, empat\u00eda y lucha a costa de vidas ajenas, no hay nada que le gane al ser humano. Estamos ante un libro que logra conmover e impactar. Una lectura desgarradora y que est\u00e1 magn\u00edficamente escrito. Palabras de mi estimado compa\u00f1ero de Tercios, Don Labi. He dichoLa columna central de la narrativa es la lucha entre Art Keller, el estricto agente de la DEA, y Ad\u00e1n Barrera, pongamos que es el Michael Corleone de los c\u00e1rteles mexicanos. Keller est\u00e1 obsesionado con acabar con la organizaci\u00f3n de Ad\u00e1n. Este motivo simple es la \u00fanica constante en un libro muy extenso, pero joder, como engancha.Personajes de todo tipo de personalidades como Sean Callan, es un asesino a sueldo irland\u00e9s con una carga de culpa, Nora, una prostituta de lujo con un gran coraz\u00f3n un sacerdote incorruptible llamado Padre Parada, y Ramos, el \u00faltimo polic\u00eda bueno de M\u00e9xico, que tiene una habilidad sobrenatural para encontrar a los malos.La narrativa de Winslow tiene mucho nivel a lo largo de toda la narraci\u00f3n, va juntando todas las piezas. Y hay piezas realmente incre\u00edbles. Un golpe de la mafia. Un tiroteo en las calles. Una redada de agentes antidrogas. Incluso el terremoto de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico de 1985. El poder del perro de principio a fin est\u00e1 repleto de escenas memorables. Tambi\u00e9n es emocionalmente poderoso. En su pr\u00f3logo, Winslow nos sumerge en su historia con la imagen de un ni\u00f1o muerto. Asi sin explicaci\u00f3n, y sin contexto. Despu\u00e9s cientos de p\u00e1ginas m\u00e1s tarde, regresa a esta escena, y el significado que desarrolla al colocarla finalmente dentro del marco de la historia es ingenioso. La verdad es un libro de 10.A partir de 1975, Winslow nos lleva a trav\u00e9s de treinta a\u00f1os de altibajos de la guerra sucia de Estados Unidos contra los c\u00e1rteles mexicanos de la droga. Sigue a polic\u00edas en ambos lados de la frontera, algunos limpios, la mayor\u00eda con un brazo en las sombra. Capos, escuadrones de la CIA, asesinos oficiales y no oficiales, prostitutas de diferentes niveles, militares con y sin uniforme y los que se interponen en sus caminos. En el camino, tenemos una historia suburbana de la intromisi\u00f3n estadounidense en Am\u00e9rica Latina y la captura paralela de los gobiernos del \u00e1rea por la inmensa marea de dinero de la droga que lo envolvi\u00f3 todo. La cr\u00edtica que hace Winslow en el libro sobre la pol\u00edtica de drogas estadounidense parece centrarse m\u00e1s en lo que es la represi\u00f3n y la interdicci\u00f3n.Aparte de la acci\u00f3n fren\u00e9tica, Winslow tambi\u00e9n se encarga de mostrarnos el panorama general del tr\u00e1fico de drogas. Salta de un lugar a otro para mostrarnos toda la tela de ara\u00f1a. Nos mudamos de las selvas centroamericanas a la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico a los cruces fronterizos de EE. UU y M\u00e9xico, a la ciudad de Nueva York. Nos muestra la interacci\u00f3n entre el crimen organizado mexicano y el crimen organizado estadounidense, centr\u00e1ndose en la mafia, en la mesa de los peces gordos en lugar de las pandillas callejeras en los que muchos se centran, junto con la complicidad del gobierno mexicano. Logra una transici\u00f3n perfecta entre el alcance de todo a lo que puede llegar y la intimidad con la que lo hace, y para mostrarnos desde un panorama general como para darnos los detalles m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, granito a granito de arena..\u270d\ufe0f", "num_likes": 82, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2749765342", "review_id": "2749765342", "date": "Aug 21, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Guille", "user_url": "/user/show/57810023-guille", "text": "\n \u201cExiste el dinero y la falta de dinero -dice Ad\u00e1n-, el poder y la falta de poder.

Psalms 22:20\u201dA ubiquitous theme in Don Winslow\u2019s brilliant writing is an atavistic examination of power as a force of nature. More than that, power as currency \u2013 it is a neutral element, existing as a tool to be used for various reasons and in multiple contexts. There is the pre-human, foundational power of sinew, tooth and claw \u2013 the muscular, violent power of strength and speed in martial contest seen in modern use as military might but existing in a microcosm on any playground, gym or bar. This is the power of one against another in its most animalistic form.But there is also the power of persuasion \u2013 of sex and courage. A beautiful woman has power, latent in her every move, glance and gesture. Likewise any observer of a bantam rooster \u2013 fowl or human \u2013 knows the power of confidence. In popular crime fiction, this is frequently demonstrated by the tough Irish cop with whom no one will mess.There is the power of God \u2013 manipulated and personified by the clergy, and by the belief and faith in observants. There is an old saying that religion has caused more wars than any other source. Whether as a motivator or as a pretext for land or other power exchange, theology can be a force that exerts its power over us in clear or metaphysical ways.Winslow\u2019s 2005 novel begins with a government operator in Vietnam who transfers his jungle skills closer to home to take the war against the communists to the war on drugs as a DEA agent. The author fills his decades in scope narrative with a heady mix of tasty characters to get to know. From the possessed by ideal agent, to the family Mexican drug dealers, to the New York hired hitmen and Mafiosos, to the government black operators who are just gangsters at a different level. Winlsow\u2019s Nora is also a deliciously complicated player \u2013 a high priced prostitute, really more of a latter-day courtesan who exerts her considerable power over all those who come into her sphere of influence.Two characters who stand out are Sean Callan and Sal Scachi. Callan, \u201cthe coldest mother***** I ever saw\u201d was an inner city Irish loner who discovered his particular power of violence by accident in a bar in New York. We follow his wet career of assassinations and violence throughout the book. Winslow reveals Callan as a reluctant killer, one who is tortured by his \u201cghosts\u201d and who seeks absolution while always drawn to one more job.Scachi reminds me of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Judge Holden from Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West \u2013 a Mephistophelian personification of evil and a demonstration of Winslow\u2019s theme that government is the biggest gang on the street.Brutal, authoritative, and compelling, this is also clearly a very well researched work as Winslow outlines the socio-economic effect of the drug trade and the parallel war on drugs on our global culture.Highly recommended though it\u2019s unmitigated violence will not be appropriate for some readers.", "num_likes": 64, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2744164466", "review_id": "2744164466", "date": "Sep 19, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Francesc", "user_url": "/user/show/93627572-francesc", "text": "He disfrutado much\u00edsimo. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 novela m\u00e1s redonda de principio a fin! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 capacidad de enlazar historias! \u00a1Durante tantos a\u00f1os!

In either case, it's a tragic, bloody farce.\" - Don Winslow, The Power of the DogLike most book series, I began the Power of the Dog series backwards. I read The Cartel first and this one second. Ass Backwards. But It didn't feel like I was reading it in reverse as much as just digging deeper.Don Winslow's look at the Mexican Drug War/US War on Drugs is told through the primary perspective of Art Keller, a lone wolf, obsessive DEA agent. But the story actually has four (or five) primary narrative threads. There is Art Keller - DEA, Nora Hayden - High class call girl, Father Prada - Catholic Bishop/Cardinal, Ad\u00e1n Barrera - Cartel/Federation head, and Sean Callan - Irish gangster and hitman. These characters are all suffering from their own needs, their own stories they can't seem to escape, and their own cold pragmatism. These are characters that seem all able to survive through a pragmatic realism and a cold calculation that both allows for their survival but also contributes to the suffering around them (Father Prada excluded).Like in the best of Le Carr\u00e9, the best parts of these novels contemplates the evils committed by bureaucracies trying to maintain control (the Catholic Church) or power (Mexican government), or ideological visions (CIA and DEA). It is a dizzying hole to look down when you start thinking of the evil that gets perpetrated in the name of Apple Pie and God.Obviously, this is fiction, especially the actual narratives around Art Keller, etc. But like the best of Historical Fiction, it is able to convey the temperature and altitude of the real world it is describing. Often good historical fiction provides an understanding that almost surpasses good history or biography in relaying the truth about certain situations. 'The Power of the Dog' and 'The Cartel' together do this for the Mexican Drug war. Close your eyes after reading these novels and you almost can see how close to the truth these fictions can be. Classic historical fiction does this by fictionalizing the primary characters and activities, but keeping the setting and the scenes as close to reality as possible.

Winslow's good at distilling information, even generating a pretty sweet narrative out of it, but when it comes to actually giving us a human context, he coughs up these creaky-ass images or some dreck like \"She was horrified.\" \"He was enraged.\"Also, for a novel that includes a vivid depiction of some kid dunked head-first into an overflowing outhouse, Winslow is surprisingly squeamish when it comes to people getting buggered by a hot poker. \"The Doctor uses his oven mitts to pick up a white-hot iron rod, which he inserts--'Oh my God!'

All of these locations and events share various characters that weave in and out of conflicts like a high speed motorcycle chase through highway traffic.Art Keller, while sharing the spotlight with many other characters, is the driving force behind the novel. Through guilt (and later revenge), he fights against the Mexican drug cartel, The Federaci\u00f3n, a group he inadvertently had a hand in creating. Keller is basically Batman, driven by revenge and a sense of self-righteousness. He\u2019s fighting an uphill battle against murderous criminals whom he refuses to kill, instead choosing to have them tried by a hopelessly corrupt system as he tries to be a decent man in an indecent world.However, as brutal as the world of Gotham City is, it ain\u2019t got nothing on the violence littered throughout Winslow\u2019s novel.

When it was great, it was all about man and the Big Idea, or First Contact. It was all about the discovery of revealing concepts and bizarre things.

Did Bill get his reviews mixed up?No, stay with me. I know what I'm doing. The Power of the Dog has nothing to do with science fiction.This is an incredibly well researched story about Mexican drug cartels. It is fictionalized, but several reviews that I've seen from news sources have said that this book was so well researched that it could very well be non-fiction, with key names changed.It is absolutely stunning to get a grasp on what the drug trade in Mexico is all about. Once you realize how the so-called War on Drugs inter-relates the DEA, CIA, police, Governments, Colombia, El Salvatore, Left-Wing Guerrillas, the mafia, the church, it's mind boggling. There are bad guys everywhere, and a LOT of money changing hands, making good guys bad guys. So strangely enough, I was thinking about the speculative fiction I had read in the past, and the clever little political worlds that these authors had thought up. And I was thinking, sci-fi, you ain't got nothing on this. With the clusterfuck that is the War on Drugs, you simply cannot make this shit up. The Power of the Dog takes this incredible stage and follows an obsessed DEA agent who is trying to clean up the Mexican drug cartels. 'Clean up' is a euphemism here, kids. This is a violent book. Some very nasty things happen to good and bad people.It was an excellent read and expose on what is going on down there. Having said that, I must also say that this is also a very long read and I was tiring of it with 100 pages to go. Shootout after shootout, and I just needed an ending. For this, I dock a full star.

In fact, in January, 1970, along with a couple of graduate school buddies, I took a car trip through much of Mexico. When we returned to the US, the customs guys at the border took well over an hour to search our car, an innocuous red VW bug. The Power of the Dog is an historical novel that follows that so-called war. The main characters are a Drug Enforcement officer, a CIA agent, a Mafia under boss, a contract killer from NYC, a California prostitute, a Mexican drug lord and his enforcer brother and a literal cast thousands of supporting roles. Winslow does a brilliant job of weaving these characters and the events that they brought about together over a many year period. In fact, there was so much going on that it was difficult to follow everything. I suspect that whatever confusion I experienced had more to do with my failing neuronal processing than the complexity of the book. If one takes Winslow's writing to heart, several things about the war on drugs became abundantly clear. The level of viciousness, corruption and profit was extraordinary on all sides. The level of competence (and in many cases, nonchalance) on the part of various US government and law enforcement agencies was almost nonexistent. Winslow does a brilliant job in bringing this period to life in a raw, colorful, intense and realistic manner. He varies his prose according to the characters and setting. He uses dialogue brilliantly to provide, not just the plot, the action and the character but the atmosphere and the extent to which it was emotionally charged. The book is long - sometimes seeming as long as the so-called war itself - and occasionally became a real effort but those periods were always brief and, on balance, it was well worth the ride.The End", "num_likes": 21, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1793644037", "review_id": "1793644037", "date": "Apr 05, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lady-R", "user_url": "/user/show/60747378-lady-r", "text": "4,5Directa, cruda, crud\u00edsima, impactante, trepidante, adictiva.Si HBO hiciera una serie basada en El poder del perro, me olvidar\u00eda r\u00e1pido de Narcos.

It's impossible to dream up fiction more extreme than the drug-related violence, corruption, cynicism, and hypocrisy that real life keeps throwing on newsprint and TV on a regular basis. There are no heroes or villains; everybody's some amount of dirty. Want to write noir? Here's your morally-bankrupt milieu, right here.Don Winslow's made a good living being the gonzo John le Carre of cartel noir, and this book is where he started.Beginning in 1975, Winslow leads us through thirty years of the ups and (mostly) downs of America's dirty war against Mexican drug cartels. It follows cops on both sides of the border (some clean, most on the arm with one shadowy group or another), kingpins, CIA hit squads, assassins official and unofficial, hookers of varying levels of proficiency, military figures in and out of uniform, and the sad sacks who get in their way and suffer grievously for their mistake. Along the way, we get a subterranean history of American meddling in Latin America and the parallel capture of the area's governments by the tsunami of drug money that engulfed everyone on all sides. If you were alive during the '70s and '80s, you'll recognize the slightly fictionalized versions of those times' headline events.The author tells this story using the voices of a passel of well-placed characters: Art Keller, a semi-bent DEA agent; Angel, Adan and Raul Barrera, who build, lose, and rebuild a drug-trafficking empire in Sinaloa and Baja; Nora Hayden, a high-priced call girl; Juan Parada, a crusading priest; Callan, a New York Irish hit man; and some bit players who for a few pages tell the story until (usually) their own stories are cut short.The main characters are invested with a level of humanity unusual for this kind of book, but normal for the author's works after \nThe Life and Death of Bobby Z\n. You'll never wonder how a character got the way s/he is no matter his/her sometimes outlandish behavior in the moment. Adan Barrera is perhaps the most sympathetic cartel boss you'll ever meet, while Keller is a most principled cop you'll watch trading away all his principles, one by one, to achieve revenge for the wrongly killed. Even Nora, who verges on the cool-blond-beach-goddess fantasy that shows up in several of Winslow's books, gets to be a relatively real person who actually does something other than decorate the set.Continuing a path he started in Bobby Z, the voice Winslow uses is brash, slangy, attitudinal and profane; not quite yet the up-yours tour de force of \nSavages\n, but you can see it from here. His dialog -- always his strongest suit -- can be a kind of tough-guy poetry at its best, while his narrative often sounds like interior dialog rather than an author's voice. Don't look for extensive scene-setting here -- Winslow's always been less interested in the places he takes us than he is in the people who pass through them, so a line or two may be all you get to set the stage.With all this relative goodness, where'd the fifth star go? (Actually, it's a half-star, but once again fractional stars aren't at our fingertips.) For one thing, this is a loooong book (541 pages). After enough nasty murders or convoluted betrayals, you go numb. Some of the characters get a few too many convenient escapes from impossible situations. Nora's the only significant female character, with the rest of the women confined to the kitchen or bedroom or being crosses the male characters have to bear. You'd better have a well-developed taste for cynicism and dark conspiracy, too, because the author throws in every misdeed any side has ever been accused of. Fans of the CIA, for instance, will find plenty to hate about this book.The Power of the Dog is like the Mario Puzo version of \nTraffic\n: a generation-long crime opera that encompasses the ruination of individuals and nations alike. When it's good, it's very, very good, but it doesn't always control its own worst instincts. If this sounds like your brand of nose candy, there's a sequel of sorts (\nThe Cartel\n) written ten years later, and it's easy to see how the author's six years of research led to his Drugs-in-Laguna cycle. If you liked \nDawn Patrol\n or \nSavages\n, you might want to circle around to Dog to get the backstory. Be warned, though: this isn't those books. Nobody's charming, and nothing is cool.

Through Art Keller, Winslow delivers a rich and deeply satisfying plot driven by a tainted protagonist whose moral compass is as skewed as the fractured blue line that policies the borderline war on drugs. One of the strengths of THE POWER OF THE DOG is the mutli faceted characters. The reader gets to see them grow with each predicament they face.

It is only 560 pages long and I say only because this novel is so intoxicatingly good that it is difficult to put it aside even for a moment. It is a novel not just about the drug war against the Mexican cartels, based loosely on real events, but it is a story about all kinds of people caught up in the war from the DEA agents who lost their regular lives, but not their souls, to the young kids who grew up to be killers, both on the streets of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and in the barrios of San Diego and Tijuana. It is a novel that talks about the brutal corruption of Mexican politics and the compromised culture of just about everything because of the drug money and violence and about all the people swept up into it and the victims of the ever-growing violence.It is a story that is at times critical of the War on Drugs, citing it as ineffective, compromised by other interests such as funneling weapons and dollars against Communist incursions into Central America and Colombia. It is a story about how difficult it has been to control this situation which has grown more and more out of control. But, the novel tells the story not as a news account but as a fictional story with real characters who have real connections to each other and histories and cultures. Winslow traces the history of these characters from their early years as they cross paths time and time again.

It is a mean, dirty story where it is not always easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys.This is not a mere cop and crime story. Winslow goes much deeper than that. While not strictly historical fiction, because Winslow tends to change the names to protect the guilty, and omit the names to blur which Presidential Administration particular acts may be attributed to, consider this a sweeping look at \"The War on Drugs\" from the founding days of the Drug Enforcement Administration in the mid-1970s to the end of the Nineties. Winslow's protagonist is Art Keller, a Vietnam Veteran. More fitting for having been an intel operative in the Phoenix Program during the Vietnam War, the program for the assassination of suspected Viet Cong leaders. Keller is not regular army. He is CIA.When the Drug Enforcement Administration was founded in the Seventies, many former Vietnam vets found themselves recruited into DEA ranks, including former CIA operatives. They found themselves on the outside, at odds with other law enforcement who had not been recruited from the Vietnam experience. Known as \"Cowboys,\" they were spurned by their civilian counterparts and locked out of intel and operations when possible.Art Keller finds himself \"Locked out\" by his supervisor Tim Taylor who has stationed him in Mexico to shut down the heroin trade. But Keller has something going for him Taylor hasn't counted on. Keller's mother was a Latina. Essentially abandoned by his gringo father as he grew up in the barrio, Keller understands what it means to be Mexican. By apparent luck he finds himself in the boxing ring as the sparring partner of Cesar Barrerra, managed by brothers Raul and Adan. Keller is accepted. And wouldn't you know it, Tio, Uncle, Miguel Angel Barrerra, is a ranking Mexican police official who leads Keller to credit in shutting down the heroin traffic in Mexico and killing the heroin kingpin.Here's the complication. Tio has a motive. Keller was actually a tool. Tio Barrerra establishes a Federacion to distribute cocaine the up and coming drug to the streets of the United States. Enter the Columbian Drug Cartels. Enter the Mafia Connection. Oops. Enter the Contra Connection. Uh-oh. Enter the CIA support of the Contras who are under indictment for Trafficking Cocaine.Faster than you can say Ollie North, here portrayed as Major Scott Craig, Art Keller finds himself caught between the CIA and the Barerras fighting the good fight in the war on drugs. However the Barrerras are always just one step ahead of him.The key to any good narcotics investigation is the development of intel. Best source? Informants. However, now one tips on the Barrerras. It will get you killed. Keller gets antsy and practical. Following Tio Barrerra, he discovers Tio has taken a young lover and an apartment as a secret love nest. In a \"Say it ain't so Keller\" moment, Art plants an illegal bug. The intel is golden. On the basis of information received from a \"reliable confidential informant\" Keller begins to do serious damage to the Barrerra Operation.Keller has two partners, one, Ernie Hidalgo, kidnapped by the Barrerras. Hidalgo is brutally tortured to discover the identity of Keller's informant. Of course, Hidalgo doesn't know. In the process of the torture Hidalgo dies.What results is the ultimate vengeance tale. Keller is out to get the Barrerras. The Barrerras are out to get Keller. At the same time there are forces at work to shut Keller up as well. For reasons having nothing to do with his mission to avenge the death of his partner.Winslow will keep you on the edge of your seat. He provides you with a cast of characters and story reminiscent of The Godfather, but with the intensity of Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone.This is the thinking reader's dope novel. It is a novel of morality, ethics, and the ease with which those essentials may be lost. Save us from the power of the dog.14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.19 But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help me.20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.21 Save me from the lion's mouthPsalm 22, KJV", "num_likes": 19, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2016", "crime", "war-on-drugs", "drug-cartels", "mexico", "columbia", "dea", "cia", "iran-contra-hearings", "opus-dei"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3325448880", "review_id": "3325448880", "date": "Jun 07, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Tony", "user_url": "/user/show/5456932-tony", "text": "I know it\u2019s a cliche but this really is a rollercoaster of a book.

My rating of this book is based on its subject matter and its research and how it affects me as a reader.Normally, I throw up my eyebrows in quizzical fashion when reading reviews that complain about the lack of verisimilitude, or that the author somehow has invented something in the reader's hometown that isn't true and therefore the whole novel is to be ridiculed and cast aside. It's fiction, the stuff's made up, folks! If you want realism, all the facts checked, then view your favorite documentary, or news column (not that facts are checked in the news), or gain your verisimilitude from reality TV! The beauty in art, as well as fiction, is that the author presents a view that is NOT as the world is. So, get over it.Having said that, if this novel's painstaking research is any indication (last count, the author spent 6 years doing research to pull this one off - that's 2,190 days) then what you will read will floor you. I say this if even a fraction of it is true. So, though fictionalized competently if not expertly, this book is about reality.Some reviewers call it Winslow's best, some his second best: with Savages and The Winter of Frankie Machine as the contenders. For myself, coming to this second Winslow book after reading the first in the Neal Carey series: A Cool Breeze on the Underground I can easily declare The Power of the Dog to be his best. With over 520 pages, it far surpasses the only other book I've read of Winslow's.So, I'm not going to talk about prose, setting, or the book's stylistic shortcomings. It's useless. Winslow has me in a corner because the subject matter is so devastating that it commands our attention every step of the way. The only thing to discuss is the veracity of what this novel is about and our opinion as readers of that truth. And if there's praise to be gifted to this novelist, than that praise belongs to Winslow for allowing us to see the consequences of the War on Drugs as seen through the eyes of the innocent and the not-so-innocent: the 3 or 4 fictional characters we follow across 3 decades.What is a War on Drugs? What is war? This is what I got from the book:War should be understood as political violence. We are obviously not actually waging a war on drugs. Drugs can't wage war. Drugs sit in plastic wrapping, or in a crack pipe. Ok. so who, then? Who or what are we waging war against? And why don't we call this war for what it really is? A political cold war that never ends. A war where the proliferation of hard drugs in our streets is the last thing of consequence. Drugs equals money, and money finances political violence. That is what Winslow tells me. But the collateral damage! I've heard that...that every war has them. But there's a difference between collateral damage that can't be avoided, and pure brutality for the sake of brutality. I find it horrific. This book is about sociopaths and psychopaths in power... what they will do to keep an idea away from this border while working for the U.S. government and against it. Winslow proves to us that ethics is only possible if you have a choice: faced with violence there is no such thing as ethics. There is a line between collateral damage and terrorism; and that line is drawn for the reader. And it is who steps across that line that floors you.And, so I think it's in this epic span of 3 decades, within this collateral damage that Winslow finds a chilling home for his novel and it's main characters. Fascinating book...I thought.

Characters started flattening out, repetitive gun battles where it seemed the major characters had an almost hobbit-like ability to survive, and a general sense of looseness as the epic subject (the drug wars) seemed to go beyond Winslow's pulpish grasp. There are a number of awesome, blood soaked scenes. A favorite of mine was early on where an Irish enforcer tries to lean too hard on a couple of teenagers in a bar. Bad move. There's another scene or scenes, involving a mother (and her children), running away from her drug dealer husband, in order to be with her thought-to-be lover, that is about about as cruel as anything I've ever read. In other words, Winslow can definitely push your buttons, and at his best, he has an ear for dialogue that is often reminiscent of Elmore Leonard. When he's not at his best, cliches start popping up, and plotting gets clunky. In particular, there is a long Mexican Day-of-the-Dead sequence that I found incredibly awkward. It recalls the operatic kill-offs from the Godfather movies, but it lacks their cohesion and flair. It was then that I knew the wheels had come off. It was also around then that Winslow seemed to be relying more and more on the actual history of the drug wars to push the novel, and its fictional characters, along. When that goes beyond a certain point, your characters begin to hollow out and become cartoons or pieces to move around. You no longer care. At least I didn't.

Don Winslow\u2019s epic powerhouse of a story about the Mexican drug cartel and the US War on Drugs is flat-out incredible! If you\u2019re a fan of shows like The Sopranos and The Wire and you haven\u2019t consumed The Power of the Dog in some form, you\u2019ve made one hell of a serious mistake with your life. This is a vital and necessary work of epic crime fiction, one that is consistently interesting as it is entertaining.Spanning nearly thirty years, The Power of the Dog charts the rise of the Barrera crime family and the syndicate of Mexican drug cartels they are at the head of. Obsessive DEA agent Art Keller is partly responsible for the rise of the Barrera\u2019s and he risks everything \u2014 his life, his family, and even his own country \u2014 to stop them.While Keller and the Barrera\u2019s are the core characters, Winslow paints a very broad picture of drug trafficking and the efforts of the United States\u2019 government to curb the incoming shipments of heroin and cocaine from across the border. There\u2019s rival Mexican cartels, the New York mafia, the CIA, the DEA, prostitutes, and killers, all of whom are ensnared in some way, shape, or form with drugs. Winslow has meticulously researched the War on Drugs, the relationship between the cartels and the police, the levels of corruption within both that support and fuel one another, and the ways in which this war grew intertwined with covert efforts to halt the spread of communism in Latin America, bringing us into the world of organized crime and gun smuggling as the Mexican Trampoline provides a conduit for Colombian cocaine to enter the US.In addition to be an incredibly rich and layered narrative, one that examines drug crimes from multiple perspectives and levels, The Power of the Dog is also a searing indictment of American policies in drug laws, Mexican corruption, and the US War on Drugs. Over the course of thirty years of foreign policy, the US has only succeeded in helping the cartels grow fat and rich, helping to spread drugs to its citizenry, and operating with flagrant hypocrisy smugly wrapped up in a false air of moral superiority \u2014 and there ain\u2019t no wall that can contain that. Keller\u2019s attempts to halt drug trafficking over the thirty year period Winslow examines oftentimes puts him at odds with his own bosses, as well as the Attorney General who far too soon declared victory on the War on Drugs and maintains there is no cocaine in Mexico. The DEA\u2019s efforts, meanwhile, are sabotaged by CIA operations in South America, which sees the US government covertly providing Contra guerillas with training and support, helping them to smuggle guns and drugs, in turn aiding the cartels to ensure drugs are distributed all across America.Although this is a work of fiction, Winslow has clearly done his homework and his narrative has a crystal clear measure of authenticity. The procedural aspects of the narrative ring true, from Keller\u2019s investigation to the operations of a brothel, from the CIA operations in Nicaragua to the mob-run streets of New York City, it all rings true. Thankfully, so do the characters. You can wholly understand Keller\u2019s obsessions, his attempts to make up for earlier mistakes and avenge those who have fallen victim to the violence of the Barrera cartel. Adan Barrera is fully fleshed out, his journey from a young street thug to the head of a crime syndicate immaculately told. Winslow does not skimp on any of the finer details, not even the violence that surrounds both of these men in their daily lives. The violence in particular is especially and shockingly potent, and there are two scenes in particular, one a very long and gruesome torture scene and the other an act of merciless violence atop a bridge, that I believe will stick with me forever.Winslow expertly navigates the story of drugs over several decades, and narrator Ray Porter delivers the pitch-perfect reading this material deserves. Porter is a narrator that in very short order has risen to the top of the ranks in terms of my personal favorite narrators, and he\u2019s absolutely one of the best in the business, to the point that I\u2019ll now buy an audiobook simply because he\u2019s attached. This man is a freaking powerhouse of a performer capable of making each character distinct, no small task given the number of characters we meet over the course of this book\u2019s 20 hour-plus runtime. Porter utilizes a wide range of tones, pitches, inflections, and accents to make every one of Winslow\u2019s characters stand out. He has a full command of the text and understands the nuances of the spoken word, injecting appropriate measures of gravitas as needed and making you feel the sharp, edgy points of Winslow\u2019s words. I haven\u2019t heard a bad production from Porter yet, and I\u2019m not honestly sure there even is one. Winslow\u2019s talents as an author are obvious, but it\u2019s Porter\u2019s narration that\u2019s going to ensure I listen to The Cartel rather than explore it in print or ebook. And oh yes, to be sure, I will be digging into The Cartel soon. I do need a short break from crime epics, but short it will indeed be. I\u2019m already jonesing for another fix from Winslow, and with the third and final installment in this series, The Border, just weeks away I can tell I\u2019ll be going on a bender with these last two books. For all the failings in US drug policy and ills and evils of the Mexican cartels that Winslow recounts in immaculate detail, I suppose it\u2019s only natural that he succeed in making me an addict, the hypocrite.

The obvious comparison is to Mario Puzo's The Godfather. I mean in topic, scope and quality. Honestly, I have trouble remembering The Godfather. I read it about 20 years ago, and enjoyed it. However, I have to admit that I struggle to remember specific things that that book did well, because I've seen the film so many times and that dominates my memory. But if you are looking for a book that grabs you and delivers on an epic scale, with memorable characters, this should do it for you. Just be ready for graphic violence, including up-close-and-personal torture scenes.Winslow uses a combination of well-known real life kingpins from the Colombian and Mexican cartels in the background, and his own colorful characters - DEA agents, drug lords, a first class prostitute, priests and Italian American and Irish American toughs from Hell's Kitchen, NYC. The journey begins in 1975 and follows their careers through 1999, first dealing primarily with the heroin trade, and subsequently with cocaine. I thought the \"War on Drugs\" began with President Reagan. But it was started by President Nixon. One reviewer on the book's jacket said that The Power of the Dog (written in 2005) \"burns with rage at the badly flawed US War on Drugs.\" Going in, I had no preconceived notions about whether our government's actions in this regard have been misguided. In support of that reviewer's take on Winslow's possible agenda, his primary DEA agent does say \"Billions of dollars, trying unsuccessfully to keep drugs out of the world's most porous border? One tenth of the anti-drug budget going into education and treatment, nine-tenths of those billions into interdiction? And not enough money from anywhere going into the root causes of the drug problem itself. And the billions spent keeping drug offenders locked up in prison, the cells now so crowded we have to give early release to murderers. ... Our solutions are the same futile non-solutions - build more prisons, hire more police ... Most people ... who want to kick drugs can't afford to get into a treatment program ...\" I don't have any answers, and there is a good chance that attacking the problem differently could be more effective. The other side of the coin is to ask what Central and North America would look like now if nothing had been done.From a surface viewpoint, the abject poverty in Colombia and Mexico certainly provided a fertile ground for illegal crops, successful gangs, power vacuums filled by those with the will and money to dominate, and rampant corruption. Considering the standard of living, it's not hard to imagine how little it might take to \"buy\" a police officer or an entire force of them. I took a look at some websites that rank corruption by country, and in various rankings Mexico comes in between the 2nd and 20th percentile in terms of most pervasive corruption. Winslow also briefly discusses the bizarre schism between the Vatican and the Mexican government that existed for about a hundred years.The Power of the Dog was a joy to read largely because of Winslow's mastery of the vernacular of the criminal world. Crime lingo and cultural lingo are front and center. Winslow is a very visual writer. The story is brutal and unrelenting, with a worldwide scope, from the neighborhood thug to the highest levels of power, both legitimate and self-declared.

Like the \"War on Terror\" that followed it, the War on Drugs is the result of corrupt mismanagement, inadequate policies, and an unclear objective. It was lost from the word go, in other words.I picked up \"The Power of the Dog\" because I've heard from all corners that Don Winslow's recently completed Cartel Trilogy is the bee's knees, which is say, astoundingly good, so I started at the beginning as one is generally meant to do. This is a very good start. There are moments when the larger story feels occasionally at risk of serving as a set piece for the action sequences, but Winslow always comes through in the end to redirect the narrative. This is largely rich, hugely compelling stuff, absolutely necessary reading for those who don't understand how buying drugs in the US indirectly leads to death and terror being inflicted upon innocent civilians on the other side of the border. It should make you think twice about the origins of everything we consume.As for the story, think \"The Godfather\" crossed with \"Traffic,\" \"Sicario,\" and \"The Wire.\" Sounds pretty good, right? If we were an adult country, we wouldn't prohibit any drugs. Boom \u2014 the cartels go away. Do what certain European countries have done, limit drug use to certain areas, require hard-core drug users to shoot up under supervision, funnel the trillions we spend on doomed efforts like the War on Drugs towards education, community outreach, and mental health programs to give people a sense of purpose so they won't turn towards drugs in the first place.

It was fantastic. This book is going in my top 10 reads of the year. This is a fictional story based on a bunch of real life events. It starts in the 1970's with the formation of the DEA and the beginning of the US's complicated relationship with Mexico and the \"War on Drugs\". This covers the time period from the 70's to the beginning of the 2000's. Art Keller is an ex-Special Forces soldier who is recruited to the newly formed DEA after Vietnam. He meets two young Mexican men and their uncle and this relationship changes the rest of Art's life. The four of them embark on a tale of greed and violence and corruption where the bad guys aren't always completely bad and the good guys end up doing some pretty bad things themselves. And there's the never-ending moral question Art faces. Is it ok to do bad things if you're doing it for a good reason? As I said, the author takes real life events and weaves this fictional tale around them. It starts with Operation Condor and the kidnapping of Enrique Salazar and then spans the next 30 some odd years with some highlights (or lowlights I should say) such as the Mexico City earthquake in 1985, the Iran-Contra hearings and how Monsanto made it's money (just to name a few). A lot of these events happened when I was a child and/or teen so I didn't really know much about them and it took me over two weeks to read this because I kept stopping to google things and I fell in to a rabbit's hole of American and Mexican history. The author stays pretty historically accurate while weaving his character's through these events.When this started I wasn't sure about it. There were a lot of characters and a lot of things going on. At first I wasn't sure how all of these people were going to be connected but as the story unfolds I was completely drawn in. The author has a real gift of creating fascinating characters who you find yourself connected to. (Even the bad guys) I was on pins and needles for the last few chapters. I uttered more than one \"Omg!\" out loud and I was genuinely sad at the outcome for a few of the characters.I listened to this on audio and the narrator did an excellent job. In a way I wish I would have read a physical copy of this because it would have made stopping to look up the historical events easier. If you enjoy audiobooks though I do highly recommend this narration.So......I loved everything about this epic tale and I can't wait to move on to the next book in this series The Cartel If you haven't read this author before this is a great place to start. ** It should be noted though that there are a few torture scenes that are pretty rough so if this is something that is an issue for you, may want to skip this.**", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["zz2017", "audio", "murder-suspense", "5-star-reads"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/179285702", "review_id": "179285702", "date": "Jun 24, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "manuti", "user_url": "/user/show/5647747-manuti", "text": "Ya estamos a medio camino del a\u00f1o.

The Power of the Dog is epic and compelling and reminds me more than somewhat of James Ellroy. Yep, I don\u2019t make that comparison lightly. Not saying it\u2019s quite as good as Ellroy but it has the same scope and, like Ellroy, shines a light deep into the morally ambiguous, dark heart of the American dream. The War On Drugs. How simple it must have seemed when first conceived by Richard Nixon but, as with prohibition, the law of unintended consequences always wins out. A brilliant cast of characters help to forensically examine every aspect of this most unwinnable of wars: Art Keller the obsessive DEA agent; the ruthless Barrera brothers, heirs to a drug empire; high class prostitute Nora Hayden; Father Parada the incorruptible people's padre; hit man and Irish gangster Sean Callan; former US colonel and made guy Sal Scachi; and on and on and dizzyingly on.No one emerges unscathed. Everyone is compromised: corrupt agencies, the church, politicians, Governments, tainted do-gooders, psychopaths etc. The result? Violence, death, despair, drama and disillusionment. If you like Ellroy, the Netflix series \"Narcos\", the 2015 film \"Sicario\" etc. then rest assured, this is another classic about the War on Drugs.5/5", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2041328694", "review_id": "2041328694", "date": "Jul 01, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Jonfaith", "user_url": "/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "text": "Jim Gauer ruined this variety of literature for me.

I would've placed the book down were it not for the scene involving the Mexico City earthquake. There was a grim beauty there. The novel spans thirty years and follows a number of characters a DEA agent and veteran of the CIA Operation Phoenix where in Vietnam teams attempted to destabilize the insurgency by assassinating the leadership cadre. This motivational theory/therapy was then applied in Central ad South America during the heady Reagan era to keep the Marxists away. These are dirty tactics, most likely illegal and unconscionable by any metric. I have no doubts they have simply been revised for our enlightened age-- but drones are so surgical. There is also a prostitute with an honest soul and an Irish assassin looking for peace, an omelet and the girl who \"got away\".

The author Don Winslow did not really have to make up much stuff for his novel as the actual historical events the book is based on are incredibly cinematic, full of amazing drama, with fascinating male as well as female demimonde characters, and unbelievable graphic gore. All Winslow had to do to write this book describing \u2018The War on Drugs\u2019 America has been supposedly fighting for the last sixty years in partnership with Mexico is do some research, change names and redraft events, and eliminate most of the peripheral real-life huge cast of characters who were actually involved in illegal drug trafficking. In this stripped-down fictional version of the illegal-drug packaging, transport and smuggling enterprise of Mexican cartels, moral ambiguities and compromised social and political responsibilities are demonstrated through single representative characters symbolic of the millions of people who are actually involved in the illegal drugs business. Yes, I meant millions - that is not a typo.The author starts his illustrative fictional history with chapters alternating between showing ongoing sparring of certain American investigators and members of a Mexican drug cartel with coming-of-age flashbacks showing how the various characters chose their careers. Pasts of childhood poverty, parental abandonment, betrayals and crime haunt many of the main characters as adults, but while some become drug cartel members, others become law enforcement officers. All involved become familiar with horrible violence, but the cartels embrace and cause excessive and purposeful terror and torture while the investigators attempt to manage their worst impulses to harm. Arthur Keller is recruited in college by the CIA, but he transferred into the DEA after a few years. He begins his career gathering intelligence on Mexican drug growers in 1975, a true believer in \u2018The War on Drugs.\u2019 As the decades, police operations, and American administrations pass into history, he is a \u2018hard man\u2019 by 1992, no longer trustful of his own government and its justice, much less Mexican law enforcement. But he hangs onto what is left of his hope to capture and takedown the Barrera Cartel.Ad\u00e1n Barrera, with his more violence-loving and wild brother Ra\u00fal, is born into the Barrera cartel, begun by his uncle Miguel \u00c1ngel Barrera. Ad\u00e1n takes on more and more duties and responsibilities as he grows up under the benefits of corruption and drug money. Ad\u00e1n is originally a sympathetic and ordinary person. But as the competition between cartels becomes deadly, and the Mexican and American police forget their civilized rules of engagement, Ad\u00e1n changes.Sean Callan\u2019s neighborhood is Hell\u2019s Kitchen in New York City. He becomes involved with the Irish mafia in 1977 at age seventeen. It was an accident. Well, it was a defensive killing to help out a friend, Stevie \u2018O-Bop\u2019 O\u2019Leary, that forced him to join the mafia. Eddie \u2018the Butcher\u2019 Friel, a made guy and collector for Big Matt Sheehan, decided to kill O-Bop. Before Callan realized what he was doing, he shot The Butcher. Things get a bit scary, but after the dust settles, Callan is an assassin for the mob.Nora Hayden becomes a prostitute in 1981. She is beautiful and men begin hitting in her at age fourteen. She realizes she likes the gifts and money. At first, she simply agrees to be the companion of 'boyfriends' strictly for the trips, tips, and gifts, but a serendipitous meeting with a professional Madam changes her life. Nora willingly learns everything she needs to be a professional courtesan by the time she is sixteen. Her first day as an official whore she is selected by Jimmy 'Peaches' Piccone. Peaches recently became the direct boss of Callan after a slight adjustment of management in Callan's mafia, now run by Paulie Calabrese. Paulie refuses to have anything to do with drugs. Peaches has other ideas about drugs. Peaches wants to start dealing with a Mexican drug cartel. Nora hopes she never has to have anything to do with Peaches again, but life can be strange and fateful. She likes Callan, not knowing he is a mafia assassin.Gentle reader, the plot is vaguely reminiscent of some famous Italian operas or American cowboy Westerns, if it was an opera or Western movie that revolves around graphic soul-destroying torture, violence and death, including that of small innocent bystander children, along with the destruction of both good and bad guys. Not that good guys and bad guys can always be strictly determined. Everybody lies down with dogs.I like this novel, but I think it suffers a bit in connecting readers to the characters from including a very long zigzag historical timeline about Art\u2019s career chasing down the particular Barrera Mexican cartel for which he has an obsession. The story is broad but brief in describing historical events mixed in with fictional elements and yet microscopic at the same time, since it shows us readers what happened within one drug-dealing fictional Mexican family cartel, based on factual events involving real Mexican drug cartels and South American countries.I am a longtime observer of the American \u2018War on Drugs\u2019. I have seen several administrations declare a victory in \u2018stopping\u2019 all drug infiltration into America with much feigned confidence. I have witnessed the so-called ultimate \u2018stopping\u2019 of all illegal drugs from getting to addicts here in the States announced triumphantly in the 1970\u2019s, the 1980\u2019s, the 1990\u2019s, and the otts up to now. Illegal drugs were \u2018stopped\u2019 from Mexico, Colombia, the Golden Triangle (Thailand, Laos, Myanmar), Afghanistan and Pakistan, and now deadly opioids from China. Not. I am being satirical about how America\u2019s 'War on Drugs' has stopped ANY drugs, obviously.Also, rarely mentioned anymore are the still numerous meth and other drug labs which are creating new chemicals making more powerful drugs easily obtainable right here in the Homeland - which no Wall can keep out, since these drugs are being made in neighborhoods all over America using chemicals bought and made here in America. I have seen several different waves of illegal drugs which have been declared as wiped out forever by various American administrations. There was an epidemic of heroin in the 1950\u2019s - 1970\u2019s, which has mysteriously staged a comeback in 2018. We had \u2018speed\u2019, uppers, and downers, tranquilizers, psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms) and barbiturates in the 1970\u2019s. Then after they were \u2018stopped\u2019, we had cocaine and crack and disco drugs in the 1980\u2019s. There was Ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, Rohypnol, Meth. Now, new recreational designer drugs, like bath salts and synthesized marijuana, are killing youths.Below is a link to an independent film on youtube. It might be behind a paywall, I don\u2019t know, as I have a Premium subscription. It is long documentary, too. It covers a lot of ground in more recent developments in \u2018The War on Drugs\u2019, as well as it clearly supports the position of decriminalizing marijuana. But it also supports the novel in many of its reality-based background details, i.e. the CIA gives support and cover for drug cartels all over the world because of various secret American government money-making/military objectives/weapon-sales deals. The CIA also betrays the drug cartels routinely. I remember reading many stories since the 1970\u2019s which describe the drug mafia collaborations, the Ronald Reagan/Oliver North Iran-Contra scandals, and about the privatized prisons using inmates for slave labor, 60% of the prisoners being incarcerated for nonviolent drug crimes, and mostly being Black people - right? Right?, who have been caught and convicted.https://youtu.be/vD3snUVJiQEHere is a link to a YouTube BBC documentary about American fentanyl addicts:https://youtu.be/_KsaWpeCj98I think the insatiable appetite of many Americans from all classes of society for many drugs is rarely addressed, except when making documentaries showing addicts hitting bottom. Why is that? And why is there very little money made available for long-term treatment at medical facilities and free drug substitutions which actually help addicts directly, despite the proven failure of the usual solutions society has tried for a century of moralistic handwringing and victim shaming with accompanying earnest prayer circles? The billions spent eradicating poppy and coca fields in foreign countries (obviously a Big Fail) would be better spent in America on treatment, housing and long-term psychiatric care of addicts, which would truly help. But non-addicted Americans also clearly vote with their cash for using drugs a lot, no matter the anti-drug campaigns and professed denials and lies about not touching drugs. It seems to me the larger issue is being avoided by everyone.

Without them, cocaine and marijuana would be like oranges, and instead of making billions smuggling it, I\u2019d be making pennies doing stoop labor in some California field, picking it. And the truly funny irony is that Keller is himself another product because I make millions selling protection against him, charging the independent contractors who want to move their product through La Plaza thousands of dollars for the use of our cops, soldiers, Customs agents, Coast guard, surveillance equipment, communications . . . This is what Mexican cops appreciate that American cops don\u2019t. We are partners, mi hermano Arturo, in the same enterprise. Comrades in the War on Drugs. We could not exist without each other. >After a quick -- and disturbing -- look at the cost of the War on Drugs in 1997, Winslow takes us back to 1975 in the State of Sinaloa, Mexico. There we meet new DEA agent Art Keller -- a Vietnam vet, who's come to use his experience to help take on the Opium trade. Thanks in large part to those efforts, the Opium trade is devastated -- but the industry shifts to cocaine, and well -- things go from bad to worse.We follow Art's career from 1975 to 2004 -- watching him try to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico into the U.S. Calling that a Quixotic effort seems to be an understatement at best -- but one particular cartel has made things personal for him and he directs most (if not all) of his efforts -- you could argue most of his life -- at disrupting their business and, hopefully, dismantling it. It's no small task, and no quick battle.But this isn't just Art's story -- he disappears from the focus several times, in fact. It's also the story of a maverick Mexican priest as he struggles to minister to various drug dealers, their family members -- and their victims. We get to know some members of the Federaci\u00f3n very well (too well, in some cases). Also, because the Federaci\u00f3n needs customers, we meet several, ahem, NYC-based importers. Connected to all of the above is a high-class prostitute. We see these characters moving through actual history -- Iran-Contra, the Mexico City Earthquake, political shifts in Washington. It was striking reading this in 2018/2019, remembering that once upon a time the name \"Giuliani\" was an invocation of law and order -- a name that symbolized a change in organized crime's power (at least perceived). Watching these individual's stories weave in and out of each other's over the decades and over huge geographic areas moves this from an intricate crime story to an epic. None of these criminals is wholly evil (well, you could make the case for a couple of them, maybe), there are very relatable moments for just about all of them. They love, they laugh, they nurture their kids -- they do good things in their community. The same can be said for the law enforcement characters -- they aren't wholly good, in fact, some of what they do is downright despicable. All of them, in short, are very human.Winslow's skilled at weaving in seemingly disparate tales into this tapestry and eventually you can see enough of it to appreciate why they're all there. There are scenes in this book that are among the most depraved I've read. Scenes of torture, scenes of murder, scenes of heartbreak. But they're not written for thrills, they're not exploitative -- they're just horrific, and very likely based on something that actually happened. There's a sweet little love story, tucked away in the middle somewhere that I kept wondering why we were getting. It was hundreds of pages, really, before I learned why -- I enjoyed it while I could. There is within this book a very heavy critique on the so-called War on Drugs in the U.S. -- at the very least, on the way it's being waged. Sometimes this comes from the narration, sometimes from a narcotraficante (see the opening quotation), sometimes from DEA agent -- it doesn't really matter whose mouth the critique comes from, it's biting and it's typically on point. It will likely make many people uncomfortable -- by design; it should make many people upset. But Winslow never browbeats you with these critiques -- unless you take the entire book as one, which it very arguably is.I don't know if I have the ability to describe Winslow's writing here. Despite the scope and intricacy of the plot, it's not a difficult read. Despite the horrors depicted, it's not overwhelming. In fact, there are moments of happiness, and some pretty clever lines. Which is not to say there's a light-hand, or that he ever treats this as anything but life-and-death seriousness. It's not an easy, breezy read -- but it's very approachable.I don't know if there's a moment that reads as fiction, either -- if this was revealed to be non-fiction, I would believe it without difficulty. I will not say that he transcends his genre to be \"Literature,\" or that he elevates his work or anything -- but I can say that Winslow demonstrates the inanity of pushing Crime Fiction into some shadowy corner as not worthy of attention of \"serious\" readers.I think I've pretty much covered everything on my pared-down outline. I really want to keep going, but I can't imagine that many have read this far. As it is, this is at best, an inadequate job describing the book and how wonderfully constructed and written it is. Hopefully, this encourages you to seek more information, or actual reviews about it. Really, The Power of the Dog is a tremendous book and should be read by many.

I read Savages and wasn\u2019t impressed much. The movie rates about a 5/10 at best so I never took Winslow seriously. I've been outside the States for almost a decade so some things are under my radar. I would highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the new sequel. I\u2019ve heard Winslow compared to James Elroy and praised by that writer as he called The Power of the Dog the War and Peace of the War on Drugs. I\u2019ve never been a fan of Elroy (nor of War and Peace) but Winslow moved way up in my estimation with this novel. Instead of James Elroy I'd say this work has more in common with Norman Mailer, especially Harlot's Ghost.Devoid of the clich\u00e9s that are the sum total of so many crime novels, The Power of the Dog brings us an epic story of America\u2019s utterly failed and corrupt War on Drugs. I love his mixing history with fiction and actually found myself looking into the Mexico City earthquake of 1985, something else that sort of passed under my radar as I was living outside the USA once again back then. The Iran-Contra affair I knew well and the disgraceful Reagan era filled with misguided patriotism bordering on fascism.This is a very difficult book to read at times as the author doesn\u2019t flinch from the horrible realities of that conflict that occurred inside the borders of our southern neighbor. The truly grotesque violence really began after this novel was published in 2005 which led Winslow to pen a sequel. And still America\u2019s bloody and expensive war on drugs continues. I remember watching lard-ass William Bennet on TV years ago when he was America\u2019s \u201cDrug Czar\u201d and completely perplexed when a reporter asked him to point to a single thing that proved that we were winning the war. He could only ape statistics about drugs seized, arrests made, business as usual carried out but nothing even remotely resembling an answer to a simple question.But let\u2019s begin at the beginning. This is a stupid title. It\u2019s stupid if you haven\u2019t read the book and are wondering what it could be about and it\u2019s stupid if you\u2019ve finished the book and still can\u2019t understand just what the hell \u201cpower of the dog means.\u201d It\u2019s a bad title and had I just been browsing titles in a book shop I would have certainly passed on this one.This bit speaks to everything Winslow feels about our policy on drugs:\u201cMost people in my area who want to kick drugs can\u2019t afford to get into a treatment program unless they have blue-chip health insurance, which most of them don\u2019t. And there\u2019s a six-month-to-two-year waiting list to get a bed in a subsidized treatment program. We\u2019re spending almost $2 billion poisoning cocaine crops and kids over here, while there\u2019s no money at home to help someone who wants to get off drugs.

None of them are safe. People can and do, fairly often, get killed, quite grizzly in a few cases. It condemns basically everyone. From the U.S Government operating \u201clegally\u201d to further its own aims (should be all old hat for most readers, aside from a few hyper specific particulars) to the intricacies of the government in Mexico being essentially owned by Narcos as the U.S is owned by corporations. Dirty cops, dirty money. Sex, death, you know the recipe. The difference is that this narrative is specifically looking to deliver an action packed crime novel that is far more concerned with power structures and transparently showing how the system itself cannot be reformed. The people are cogs in the machine being churned. And it\u2019s quite effective at this. Surprisingly so, in fact. The plotting is well handled, and intricate; the prose are just short of great, and tend to take on the qualities of the narrator. It shouldn\u2019t work, but does. It takes on a simultaneously cinematic and intimate quality. A couple character arcs are absolutely perfect. The audiobook is fan-freaking-tastic. The narrator does everyone\u2019s voices differently and takes on the aforementioned qualities to great effect. It\u2019s an exemplary experience.So, why no 5 stars?

Combined with its successor, The Cartel, it pretty much tells you how incredibly complex, screwed up, and insoluble the drug issue is in this country. Why Winslow's two books haven't yet been made into either a Netflix series or a giant 'The Godfather'-type movie franchise is beyond me. If you want action, violence, sex, great characters, large themes, sagas of redemption and betrayal....you've come to the right place. In the big picture, the story is the US vs. Mexico in the Reagan-era 'War on Drugs'. That's the overarching background, but it's really Art Keller, the maniacally focused American leader of the charge vs. the Barrera brothers, the Mexican drug supply chain owners. There are many, many other players involved: hookers, compromised agents, politicos covering their asses, bent law enforcers, bought-off politicians, Irish hit men, mafia guys.... Typically, a novel of this nature will focus on a very narrow piece of the pie. Winslow goes oppo on that.... the nature of the topic is too complex and the actions of the characters too inscrutable without great detail, and he provides that in spades.I have to admit that I've become a fan of Winslow's writing style. He changes narrators often and tends to write in their respective voices, so you not only get multiple viewpoints (often overlapping) but also different uses of the language. His dialogue is extremely believable and he obviously has done his research on this huge topic. He's a strong writer but an even stronger story teller.

Un libro che mi *doveva* piacere (era piaciuto a tutti!), e forse questa aspettativa gli ha giocato contro, perch\u00e9 mi ha spinto a guardarlo con occhio iper-critico. O forse passare da una striscia di letture pi\u00f9 \"leggere\" a una cos\u00ec fortemente drammatica si \u00e8 rivelato uno choc difficilmente superabile (mi ero abituata a minore complessit\u00e0).Impossibile tentare di sintetizzare la complicatissima trama se non riducendola proprio all'osso: l'infinito duello tra un agente della DEA, Art Keller (uno degli esempi pi\u00f9 classici di eroe solo contro tutto e tutti), e i padroni di uno dei pi\u00f9 grossi cartelli della droga messicani, i Barrera, che si svolge su molteplici fronti e attraverso oltre due decenni, tra vittorie parziali e sconfitte interlocutorie dall'una e dall'altra parte, brutalit\u00e0 inconcepibili, doppiezze, accordi, trame politiche. Coinvolti in questa gigantesca e interminabile battaglia finiscono altri personaggi, un killer irlandese, un prelato, una prostituta, mafiosi ma anche e soprattutto i vertici della CIA, visto che in Sudamerica la guerra alla droga nasconde innumerevoli altri obiettivi, fini, ambizioni.Sarebbe un copione gi\u00e0 pronto per Hollywood e in effetti si legge come se si stesse guardando un kolossal d'azione sul grande schermo: con ci\u00f2 intendo dire che \u00e8 tutto eseguito magistralmente, la tensione \u00e8 sempre alta, ogni scena \u00e8 orchestrata alla perfezione e si incastra assieme alle altre in un meccanismo studiatissimo in cui nulla avviene per caso, la sequenza preparazione-crisi-risoluzione \u00e8 rispettata e ripetuta pi\u00f9 volte (sono le tappe della lunga guerra di cui sopra), rimani sbalordito (dal fatto che la mente dell'autore sia riuscita a governare e dirigere una tale complessit\u00e0) e col fiato sospeso, per\u00f2 non hai un vero e proprio coinvolgimento emotivo e affettivo coi personaggi... nonostante alcuni snodi della trama siano meno plausibili e sembrino studiati a tavolino proprio per aumentare la melodrammaticit\u00e0 della storia (il felicissimo matrimonio del poliziotto-eroe che si dissolve in tre pagine, l'infallibile killer che nasconde il mitra... sotto il letto, cos\u00ec che l'amatissima fidanzata per la quale sta cercando di cambiare vita lo trova subito spazzando e lo lascia...). *Quindi, storia molto bella (lo stile di scrittura di Winslow un po' meno: gi\u00e0 non mi stuzzicavano molto gli altri suoi romanzi, ad esempio Le belve, adesso penso che sia ancora pi\u00f9 difficile che io li legga), ma personaggi che sembrano attori sulla scena... Non \"soffri\" realmente assieme a loro perch\u00e9 non sembrano \"veri\" e hai sempre la vaga impressione che a un certo punto sentirai la voce da trailer che dice \"Russell Crowe \u00e8... Art Keller, Charlize Theron \u00e8... Nora Hayden... IL POTERE DEL CANE... nei cinema\". Per dire, una reazione come quella che ho avuto all'INFAUSTA PAGINA 562 de \nIl petalo cremisi e il bianco\n (quando ho dovuto interrompere la lettura e mi sono aggirata piagnucolando per la stanza per circa cinque minuti), qui non era pensabile. I personaggi, anche importanti, muoiono s\u00ec come le mosche, ma la cosa viene registrata senza troppa partecipazione, incalzati come siamo dall'azione adrenalinica o impegnati a seguire gli intrighi geopolitici (questo libro \u00e8 una manna per i complottisti, ha tutti i cattivi \"giusti\": CIA, Stati Uniti, Vaticano, Opus Dei, Israele...). Forse, era precisa intenzione dell'autore evitare ogni sentimentalismo (ma quel che dico pi\u00f9 sopra in parte sembra smentirlo), forse \u00e8 un modo per sottolineare quanto la perdita di vite umane diventi normale e trascurabile amministrazione in questi contesti. Forse. O forse l'autore non sa farci diventare \"tutt'uno\" con le sue creature.Difficile spiegare questa mia sensazione, che inoltre probabilmente ha davvero poco senso, perch\u00e9... in che modo i personaggi dei libri sarebbero pi\u00f9 \"veri\" di quelli del cinema?C'\u00e8 un altro piccolo dettaglio che ha giocato a sfavore di questo libro, ma si tratta di una mia personalissima idiosincrasia: quando leggo romanzi con i verbi al presente indicativo mi viene sempre l'ansia, come se il personaggio \"aspettasse\" me per andare avanti! E oltre tutto in questi casi il tono dell'autore suona \"brusco\" e sbrigativo: osservazioni assolutamente soggettive e di scarso valore argomentativo, certo, ma che cercano di spiegare come mai mi senta sempre \"a disagio\", lievemente irritata e sfavorevolmente colpita quando incontro libri che utilizzano questa tecnica: il passato remoto avr\u00e0 un sapore pi\u00f9 antiquato, ma mi pare pi\u00f9 adatto alla narrazione. Naturalmente, essendo questo un libro di 700 e passa pagine, dopo un po' finisci con l'abituarti e non ti sembra pi\u00f9 tanto strano.Forse sono stata condizionata negativamente da alcune recensioni lette prima di iniziare, da questo articolo su un altro romanzo dello stesso autore (recensione positiva, s\u00ec, ma alcune annotazioni qua e l\u00e0 mi avevano lasciato poco convinta), dallo stile che non \u00e8 riuscito a conquistarmi, fatto sta che ho preso il libro in mano pi\u00f9 scettica di quanto non lo avrei fatto anni fa, subito dopo averlo acquistato. La mezza stelletta in pi\u00f9 l'aveva praticamente persa per strada con l'ultimo centinaio di pagine (veramente brutto), ma alla fine ho ritenuto che un 3/5 sarebbe stato fin troppo severo: ripeto, lo sto punendo perch\u00e9 forse per una serie di circostanze mi sono auto-indotta da sola a \"non farmelo piacere troppo\". Non so spiegare bene, a volte basta la predisposizione negativa a fregarti e con certi libri, sulla carta perfetti, non \"scatta\" quel non so che; capisco perfettamente perch\u00e9 Il potere del cane piaccia tantissimo, cavolo, sarebbe dovuto piacere di pi\u00f9 anche a me. Quindi, diamogli pure 3,5/5. Ma \u00e8 un voto che tiene conto della \"stima\" pi\u00f9 che dell'effettivo gradimento.* Tranquilli, non sono parti fondamentali della trama: leggendo questo libro avevo ben presente questa vignetta, e ogni volta che andavo all'ultima pagina per controllare l'indice ero terrorizzata dall'eventualit\u00e0 che l'occhio mi cadesse sulle ultime righe dell'epilogo!3,5/5http://moloch981.wordpress.com/2012/1...", "num_likes": 7, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["narrativa", "narrativa_nordamericana", "venduto-scambiato-regalato"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2475438015", "review_id": "2475438015", "date": "Aug 04, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Anthems", "user_url": "/user/show/68579654-anthems", "text": "\"Favor con favor se paga\"\"Por tu cuenta y riesgo\"Obra magna imprescindible en su estilo.

Yo, aqu\u00ed, en cambio, resaltar\u00e9 lo que m\u00e1s me ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n como aficionado a la novela negra; y, a su vez, los defectos superficiales que he detectado, todo ello condensado de forma sucinta y esquem\u00e1tica. Veamos.1.- La caracterizaci\u00f3n: los personajes. Hay muchos, s\u00ed, todos tienen su voz, su papel, su incidencia en la trama, ninguno est\u00e1 hueco ni sobra. El trabajo en ellos es deslumbrante, en sus motivaciones, ambiciones, en su moralidad. El elenco de personalidades es magn\u00edfico; y lo m\u00e1s curioso, todos, absolutamente todos sin excepci\u00f3n, tienen luces y sombras, claroscuros, con comportamientos, durante los vaivenes de la historia, que fluct\u00faan entre el narcicismo, la egolatr\u00eda, el altruismo y la abnegaci\u00f3n. Son reales, tangibles. Protagonistas que se aferran a ti y perduran en la memoria, especialmente, en mi caso, el obsesivo y laborioso Art Keller, la bell\u00edsima y aguerrida Nora Hayden, el malnacido e inteligente, as\u00ed como sentimental y padre coraje Ad\u00e1n Barrera, y el encomiable y filantr\u00f3pico Juan Parada.2.- La magnitud de la historia y la diversidad tem\u00e1tica: la trama. La historia es genial, con una cronolog\u00eda extens\u00edsima: desde finales de los a\u00f1os 70 hasta los albores del siglo XXI. Desde \u00e9sta \u00f3ptica diacr\u00f3nica se analizan cuestiones como: -El narcotr\u00e1fico en sudam\u00e9rica, es decir, los archiconocidos c\u00e1rteles colombianos y mexicanos, su desprecio a la vida, a la salud, sus pr\u00e1cticas macabras, sus torturas, el miedo que infund\u00edan a la poblaci\u00f3n, los sobornos a las autoridades p\u00fablicas y, en general, el irreparable dolor que causaron y la atm\u00f3sfera de opresi\u00f3n que instauraron en un M\u00e9xico asfixiado por la pobreza y la delincuencia.- Las revoluciones socialistas en Am\u00e9rica Latina y la consiguiente reacci\u00f3n ultraderechista apoyada por EEUU (Plan C\u00f3ndor), esto es, macartismo puro, financiamiento de los Contra y la caza de brujas auspiciada por la administraci\u00f3n yankee. El terrorismo de Estado: Nixon y Kissinger, entre otros.- El florecimiento de doctrinas humanistas, liberales y socialistas (teolog\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n) en el seno de la reaccionaria y tradicionalista Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica y, ante ello, la connivencia de la Iglesia con la ultraderecha, que conllev\u00f3 una campa\u00f1a de genocidio ind\u00edgena, de exterminio de pensadores y activistas marxistas, de j\u00f3venes y eruditos universitarios.- La prostituci\u00f3n y el proxenetismo, la mercantilizaci\u00f3n y objetizaci\u00f3n de la mujer. El machismo y el paternalismo reinante. La cosificaci\u00f3n y el desprecio a la mujer, su reducci\u00f3n a la carne, la violencia f\u00edsica y psicol\u00f3gica hacia ella, por el mero hecho de ser mujer; y, pese a todo, la fuerza femenina, encarnada en Nora Haylen, de prosperar, de ser irreverente y contestataria, de ser solidaria con un mundo masculino atroz.- La mafia italoamericana, es decir, las famosas Cinco Familias y su gesti\u00f3n de la \"Cosa Nostra\".- El catastr\u00f3fico terremoto que asol\u00f3 M\u00e9xico en 1985. La capacidad de regeneraci\u00f3n y resiliencia de la sociedades subdesarrolladas. - La problem\u00e1tica armament\u00edstica, acompa\u00f1ada de la pol\u00edtica m\u00e1s rancia, clientelar y ajena a la ciudadan\u00eda, indolente al sufrimiento humano, soci\u00f3foba. Una pol\u00edtica, en ocasiones, confabulada con el crimen organizado que orquestaba y galvanizaba asesinatos selectivos con el objetivo de encubrir las matanzas que perpetraba contra el enemigo ideol\u00f3gico: las FARC, los sandinistas y los zapatistas. Imperialismo.Y lo dejo ah\u00ed. En fin, la idea est\u00e1 clara, libro de entretenimiento y ocio pero que tambi\u00e9n goza de una posible e interesante lectura pol\u00edtica.3.- Las imperfecciones: los defectos. A ver, el libro, al menos para m\u00ed, es una obra de arte en su g\u00e9nero, pero la nota real es de un 4,75; pues es cierto que el libro recurre al mismo mecanismo (se\u00f1alar falsamente a un culpable, sopl\u00f3n o chivato) con demasiada frecuencia. Al principio funciona, pero alterar la secuencia narrativa y avanzar siempre similarmente resta. La falta de imaginaci\u00f3n.Adem\u00e1s, el libro, al abarcar tantos temas, se hace denso, de una vastedad y una complejidad que pueden repeler al lector. A m\u00ed eso me gusta, lo disfruto; creo y defiendo, de hecho, que los escritores y sus historias tienen que exigirle un poco a los lectores, pero entiendo que un exceso de temas, enfoques y saltos temporales pueda saturar a algunas personas.En definitiva, leedlo, es un libro con fama, y lo m\u00e1s infrecuente: est\u00e1 a la altura de ella. Imperdible. En los testimoniales de la edici\u00f3n que tengo lo resumen perfectamente con una frase: \"Una hermosa visi\u00f3n comprimida del infierno\".

What an intense book! The Power of the Dog is an epic crime thriller that is powerful, intelligent, brutal, informative and riveting. The audio book is fantastic. The narrator brings the many characters in this story to life.I find this book very difficult to review because it is such an expansive story. The book is as it spans three decades of the events revolving around the illicit drug trade in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. The story follows the character Art Keller, DEA agent and his efforts to combat the \"war on drugs.\" The story is much more complex than just one man's experiences. A key component of the story is the rivalry of the different drug cartels in Mexico. There is the corruption of government officials and the grisly torture of individuals who defy the will of the drug cartels. Another subplot in the story is the crime syndicates in New York City and how they get involved in the drug business. Some of the best and humorous dialog is in this part of the book. Then there is the U.S. local police and government agencies who seek to prevent drug shipments and raid the shipments that make it into the U.S . What is also interesting the U.S. policy on drugs and how individuals try to implement the policy over time. Another compelling element of the book is the brutality and deaths of people who either get in the way or are collateral damage of warring enemies.It is the characters that bring the heart of this story to light in such a intricate and complicated backdrop. There is Art Keller who wages his own personal war on the cartels. There is a pragmatic Catholic Bishop, an Irish hit man, some Italian gangsters (one called Big Peaches), an exquisitely beautiful prostitute and numerous Mexican drug lords and their key enforcers. The characters are deftly developed and employed into the various subplots of the story.The historic fiction element of the story is that it is weaved with actual events over the time period of book. It was hard for me to discern fact from fiction because I remember reading about similar events portrayed in the book. In that respect, while the characters and situations are fictitious, the story is very real.I find the writing in the book to be overall outstanding. The plots, pacing, characters, dialog, sharp cynical humor, flows seamlessly together. I found the author making a couple soapbox speeches through the characters. The book is very well done and it is long. This last comment is both a plus and minus for the book. I think some authors/publishers might have split the book up into multiple volumes. I'm glad that didn't happen because it would have ruined the tension that flows consistently throughout the book.As mentioned earlier, I listened to the audio version of this book. I recommend the audio book if that is an option. The narrator does an excellent job with characters and content matter of the book. Spanish is used throughout the book and I think he nails the accent. There is also the New York Italian accents that are exceptionally well done. The voice inflections and emotion are expertly done in my opinion. The voices of the different characters brings focus to that character and location of where that character happens to be in the story. If this were a movie, there would be a little caption on the screen naming the different locale. Anyway, the combination of good writing and good narration comes together nicely.The Power of the Dog is an emotional roller coaster of a read. The book is so gritty and realistic that it made me wince in places.

The Power of the Dog is a thinly-novelized history of the rise of Mexico's drug cartels and the consequent corruption of its society, government, and law enforcement; the involvement of American organized crime families in the drug trade; the look-the-other-way policies of American government and military leaders seeking to preserve the business-friendly status quo in Mexico and Central America; and not least the corruption and bureaucratic infighting that make US drug-fighting agencies so ineffective. As far as I can tell, the history and events described in the novel are factual. The fictional overlay consists of made-up characters -- Mexican drug cartel leaders, American DEA agents, a Mexican cardinal, American mafiosi, and other supporting characters -- who live and tell the story, giving it immediacy and interest. The author, through the thoughts of these characters, moralizes and editorializes throughout, which I thought detracted from the story. The story itself -- the staggering levels of criminality, barbarity, and corruption -- stands on its own and doesn't need the author's moralizing. That was my only objection to The Power of the Dog. This is a good read, and an important one, but if it's the only book you're going to read about the Mexican drug cartel, it's kind of like choosing to read James Michener's novel Space, a fictionalized history of the US space program, when you could have read Tom Wolfe's brilliant non-fiction history, The Right Stuff. if you're really interested in this subject, you should read the non-fictional reportage of Charles Bowden (Murder City: Ciudad Juarez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields).", "num_likes": 7, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1356360521", "review_id": "1356360521", "date": "Aug 06, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "\u2746 Crystal \u2746", "user_url": "/user/show/19080180-crystal", "text": "Review for audiobook ~ 5 stars story \u266b 5 stars narration.

It's simultaneously a slick, relentless thriller that repeatedly kicks the reader in his or her respective genitals, a novelized history of the drug war from 1975 to 2004, and a deeply human drama that is always accessible to the reader despite heading into some very dangerous and dark territory. It's populated with vivid, all-too-likable characters that stay in palpable, constant danger for the duration and is written in a cinematic, endlessly pleasurable prose. I really struggle to think of someone I know in everyday life or on Goodreads that I wouldn't happily recommend this one to. Even if you have limited or no interest in the typical crime shit, some part of this novel will likely grab you and keep you close to it until the last page.The first thing I have to address is something that I think is really one of Winslow's strengths; character. There's a couple of the usual crime caricatures, but most of the people that populate these pages are very human and well-rounded. We have Sean Callan, an Irish kid in New York who becomes involved in organized crime via a violent act that comes about almost by a simple twist of fate; Nora Hayden, an upscale call girl with real intelligence and strength; Adan Barrera, a loving family man who also happens to be a ruthless drug lord; and the man whose shadow covers the entirety of the novel, Art Keller. Art is our hero and you WILL throw in with him. Even though he was involved with sketchy shit like the CIA and the super-questionable Phoenix Program, it's apparent that he wants to do true good in his position and not just further fucked-up agendas within the American government. He's smart, effective, angsty, obsessive, cares for his friends and loved ones and isn't afraid to put a motherfucker six feet deep when the situation demands it--the perfect hero to throw up against the truly ruthless and powerful narcos.The ever-escalating, seemingly never-ending bloody tug of war between the myriad factions that is the drug war in Mexico is a brilliant setting for an epic crime novel. The situation down there is, has been, and probably will remain confusing as fuck. Thankfully Winslow allowed this reader to get a grip on how things came to be as they are today, with some agencies like the NSA making noises about Mexico potentially becoming a failed state and requiring large-scale US military intervention. The generally timely and relevant nature of the book is only made more so for this reader as I live in one of the border states with Mexico, have a lot of coworkers and friends from Mexico and my hometown remains one of the major staging/distribution areas close to the border. \"But I live in New England (or Sweden or France or Turkey) or whatever and don't care about this desert hick stuff,\" you think. This is relevant to even the non-border states, as you have unavoidable facts like the Sinaloa Cartel (a major part of this book) running the drug trade in Chicago, to the extent that the Chicago Crime Commission recently named Joaquin Guzman (the recently-escaped leader of the Sinaloa Cartel) Public Enemy No. 1.But maybe you don't care about all of this drug war shit, and that's totally fine. I still want you to read The Power of the Dog because it's just an excellently written book. Winslow uses what I guess would be called a \"third-person-present\" format. Usually this bugs me, but I fucking swear I didn't even notice that he was using it until like halfway through the book. The scenes just spring to life with real immediacy and scream \"READ ME!\" The prose can be funny and light or poignant and serious as the grave, often turning from one to the other at the flick of a switch. It goes down smooth and then burns like a motherfucker, like expensive whiskey. Writing crime novels that are stylized to any degree has to be hard, because it's the easiest thing in the world to slip for one second and come away having written some stuff that seems like a silly parody of crime writing. Winslow never makes this mistake with his prose and keeps his sights trained on character and plot as the real focus.This was a brilliant book, and is a textbook example of when you discover an author and go \"why the hell haven't I been reading this person for years now?!\" while also being glad you get to devour this newly-discovered body of work. I couldn't resist and already started The Cartel. Winslow is truly mining new and fruitful paths in crime writing and I absolutely demand everyone on my friends list on this site give him a try. Anyone who's read any of my shit before knows that I hem and haw endlessly about whether or not I'd comfortably recommend a book to the varied and wide group that is my Goodreads friends list but I don't even care when it comes to this book, all y'all motherfuckers need to read this...I mean, obviously excepting those that can't or don't want to deal with heaping doses of cursing, drugs, fucking and murder in their fiction. One last thing that really pleased me about this novel was its strong, ever-present moral compass. A lot of crime shit can get truly morally ambiguous and grey but with Winslow you know he's writing on the side of compassion and justice.

The warriors themselves have all too often been compromised and dirty. Don Winslow introduces us to some of them in this work of fiction that reads as if it is torn from today's headlines. He shows us characters on both sides of the battle, all of them flawed even as they often also have their more humane side.Art Keller is a hard-charging DEA agent working in Mexico when we first meet him. He is fully invested in fighting this war and in destroying the supply chain of drugs that are flowing into the United States and causing untold misery. He is willing to fight dirty if that's what it takes to bring about the desired end.Early in his career, as he is trying to find a way \"in\" to the drug culture, Keller meets Adan and Raul Barerra. They are nephews to Miguel (known as Tio) who is the current head of the crime family that is sending the drugs across the border. Soon Adan will become the head of the family with Raul as the merciless enforcer.Back in New York, we meet several mafioso types, including the Piccone brothers, \"Big Peaches\" and \"Little Peaches\" and an Irish kid from Hell's Kitchen named Sean Callan who will become a stone-cold hitman. The two Peaches are eager to get a slice of the Mexican drug pie.There is Ramos who may be the last honest and unbribable cop in Mexico and who is a powerful ally of Art Keller in his crusade. Then there is Nora Hayden, a high-scaled prostitute who eventually becomes entangled with the Barerra family.And finally, we meet Juan Parada - Father Parada, a much-loved Catholic priest who proves incorruptible and a powerful enemy of the drug families.Winslow's book takes us on a 542-page epic journey through the years of the War on Drugs from 1975 to 2004. It is a notably violent journey with uncounted innocent victims as collateral damage. The writer did not soft-petal the violence at all and that at times made the narrative very hard to read for those of us of a squeamish nature.At the same time, Winslow shows us all sides of his characters and we learn that even some of the worst of them have their softer moments. It is hard to reconcile any softness with the brutal, murderous cruelties that are so much a part of their actions. For readers who require action in order to maintain their interest in a book, Don Winslow is your guy. His book is essentially a series of set pieces of incredible action. To mention only a few, there are raids by agents, street shootouts between various factions in the drug trade, the 1984 Mexico City earthquake, various mob hits, and the constant tension of planning the battles as Keller and his allies try to take down the Barerras and interdict the flow of drugs. It makes for propulsive reading of a book that is very hard to put down. The writer keeps us on the edge of our seats right up until the very end.This was my first experience of Don Winslow and I was very impressed. This, I understand, was the first book of three in this series. I'll definitely be reading the other two. At the end of this one, I could only agree with this sentiment expressed by Art Keller: \u201cArt can\u2019t decide whether the War on Drugs is an obscene absurdity or an absurd obscenity. In either case, it\u2019s a tragic, bloody farce.\u201d  ", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["thrillers"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2122797514", "review_id": "2122797514", "date": "Sep 13, 2017", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Tittirossa", "user_url": "/user/show/4445484-tittirossa", "text": "Ci ho messo quasi met\u00e0 libro per capire cosa mi ricordasse la notevolissima costruzione a tessere di mosaico e la notevolissima capacit\u00e0 di farti provare empatia (e tifare) anche per il peggio delinquente con la peggio motivazione, e poi dang! la rivelazione: \u00e8 costruito come Trono di Spade.L\u00e0 tifi e trepidi per quello stronzo incestuoso assassino di re e bambini di Jamie Lannister, qui ti ritrovi a sperare che Ad\u00e0n tenga testa ai vari narcos che gli vogliono fare la pelle.

Don Winslow\u2019s \u201cCartel\u201d trilogy is where it\u2019s really at if you want the truth concerning the hellish nightmare that is The Mexican Drug Federaci\u00f3n. Having spent two years of my life living in Michoac\u00e1n and other regions of Mexico, I can personally attest to how successfully \u201cThe Power Of The Dog\u201d captures the straight, uncompromised reality of the present situation. Indeed, Winslow\u2019s writing here is both remarkably well-researched and startlingly authentic. The story itself is also consistently eye-opening and gut-wrenching, and boasts an impressively memorable array of tragic and vicious characters, who each seem all too believable. Moreover, Winslow also delivers a thoroughly scathing expos\u00e9 of drug trafficking, violent crime, international prostitution rings, bribery, and geo-political corruption gone rampant. All together, these make for quite the resounding storytelling achievement, whose relevance is as painful as it is impossible to ignore. Reading it will no doubt make you develop a greater appreciation for the growing threat posed by Mexico\u2019s cartels, as well as ensure you lose all patience with the complete and utter ineptitude of the governments who\u2019ve tolerated them (or else are plain corrupt and sharing their bed). As an introduction to the trilogy, I found this book to be a riveting read from start to finish, and was blown away by its no-holds-barred and all-encompassing approach (especially its detailing of the shockingly unscrupulous, and sadly frequent involvement by the U.S. government / CIA which helped catalyze the whole mess). Frankly, this is bound to dampen your patriotic spirit somewhat. Before I picked this up, I would not have imagined the decade-spanning war on drugs could ever be captured in such a fascinating and comprehensive way. Well, lo and behold \u201cThe Power Of The Dog\u201d manages to pull it off in extraordinary style, and also marks the beginning of, for my money, one of the all-time greatest and most sweeping crime sagas ever written. In one single book, Don Winslow has firmly cemented his place alongside my favorite authors (I absolutely LOVED every bit of it), and with everything I hear of his other work, I have little doubt that I\u2019ll feel similar admiration for all of his writing.If crime stories and historical fiction are your thing, or if you are even marginally interested in learning about the war on drugs and how exactly it relates to Mexico, SA, and the United States, do yourself a big favor and grab this one, ASAP! Not only is it phenomenally well-written and highly accurate, it\u2019s straight-up entertaining as hell.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["crime-noir-mystery-spy", "favorites", "book-club-suggestions"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/113579009", "review_id": "113579009", "date": "Jul 26, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Giovanni Gelati", "user_url": "/user/show/3474899-giovanni-gelati", "text": "The only reason I picked up this novel was a suggestion by a Mark Greaney, he of the Gray Man novel and soon to be released on Target (Sept. 28th,2010, sorry I had to get that in there; I am looking forward to it). I think highly of Mark and his opinions, so I tried to get The Power of the Dog a.s.a.p., figuring that this is going to be a hot read. I got it, I looked at the back cover for the synopsis of the novel, and I was totally intrigued. Here is what is on the back cover: \u201cArt Keller is an obsessive DEA agent. The Barrera brothers are heirs to a drug empire. Nora Hayden is a jaded teenager who becomes a high class hooker. Father Parada is a powerful and incorruptible Catholic priest. Callan is an Irish kid from Hell\u2019s Kitchen who grows up to be a merciless hit man. And they are all trapped in the world of the Mexican drug Federacion. From the streets of New York City to Mexico City and Tijuana to the jungles of central America, this is the war on drugs like you\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d I am going to be honest and admit to not knowing of this author and his incredible work. The skill he possesses in his narratives is amazing. He switches from locale to locale throughout the novel and it doesn\u2019t feel disjointed, yet it is like a violent fabric being woven. He ties all the stories and characters together in a nice tight bundle that left me totally dumbfounded. This is creative storytelling being done by someone not only with some chops, but near mastery. I have every desire to read the rest of his work; he has really caught my interest and desire for more.I feel the title should be changed in future reprints to \u201cThe Power Of The Winslow\u201d. Boiled down to its basic ingredients, Don Winslow took a very tired plotline of the drug world, and transformed it using an OCD ex-CIA operative, greedy druggies, a ho, a crazy priest, a group of bungling Mafioso\u2019s, and a couple of Irish kids. If you haven\u2019t had the pleasure of reading Winslow\u2019s work, please do. You are opening the door to engaging humor, the human condition, and one heck of a roller coaster ride. Grab hold and feel \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d; it will take a bite out of you.What are you reading today? Check us out and become our friend on Facebook and Shelfari.

It is to Mexican drug cartels what \"The Godfather\" is to the Mafia or what \"Lonesome Dove\" is to the cowboy genre. It is a multi layered, multi inter connected ensemble piece. It touches on vast array of government agencies and initiatives as well as numerous criminal operations. Everyone gets a mention, CIA, DEA, Contras, the Chinese government, Marxist terrorists,Opus Dei and the Mexico City earthquake. As well as a multitude of agencies, characters and operations the story takes place over decades. Among others we follow Art an army veteran who is an idealist when he joins the DEA, only to find his morals being worn down over the years in his obsession to bring down Adan Barrerra. Art gets drawn into doing the wrong things for the right reasons. Adan the cold cartel boss who loves his disabled daughter. Raul is Adan's vicious brother and enforcer. Nora is a whore with a heart of gold. Callan is a gifted killer who drifted into the murder game by being at the wrong place at the right time. The set peices are memorable such as Adan being captured when a young man and being being taken in a helicopter with another prisoner, and when Callan becomes a killer. These and many other characters and their vast array back stories are carefully woven into a complex slice of U.S. and Latin American history. This is very much a shades of colour book. the good guys can be bad, the bad guys can be good. Only Parada the catholic priest has a balanced moral compass. The author delivers some killer quotes in this novel, some of which I have brain filed for future reference. e.g. \"I dont believe in God,\" Art says. \"Doesn\"t matter,\" Parada says \"He believes in you.\" or\"It's the smell of death, unimaginable if you've never smelt it, unforgettable once you have.\" or\"There is money and the lack of money, and there's power and the lack of power. And that's all there is.\"This book shows us America and the war on drugs, how the roney for the war on drugs is funneled into sycophantic corrupt states and used to fund anti communist death squads with the tacit approval of the U.S. and it is ugly and terrifying. The torture scenes are necessarily horrific.If there is a criticism, and it is only miniscule caveat, it is that the protagonists have conflict after conflict. It seems there is no end to the unrelenting betrayals and shoot outs that each character goes through in their character arc. However, as I said it is a very, very small gripe. Amazing book.

Don Winslow did six years of research to write it, I really like his writing style!The Power of the Dog is about the War on Drugs, following several main characters, spanning over 30 years. DEA agent Arthur (Art) Kellar, is obsessed with bringing down the Drug Cartels, one in particular, the Barrera's, after they torture and kill one of his friends and fellow DEA operatives. The Barrera brothers, (as mentioned above) Adan and Raul are the heirs to a powerful Mexican Drug Empire.

It has strong characters and transcends the genre in the sense that, beyond telling a good story, Winslow also gives us a portrait of what was--and still is--happening, as he sees it, in parts of South America and down around the Mexican border. The dialogue is sharp and there is plenty of action, all credibly described. Many of the characters are just plain nasty or dangerous, and the good guys don't really win out in the end--which is realistic, of course, because the drug war (as Winslow tells us) is still going strong...and, if anything, the situation is worse than ever now. Which of course reflects the current situation. And Art Keller ends up having given the best years of his life, and the best of himself, for nothing... (Or did he...? I suppose this is one of the questions we have to ask ourselves.)Winslow is telling us about what happens when a great nation's foreign policy loses its way, and when powers that want to do the right thing ultimately compromise and go with the 'my enemy's enemy is my friend' line, which has proved so disastrous in much of South America and Central America.Winslow does seem to indulge in what some readers might feel are cliches...although you may wonder as to the degree to which cliches are at times a permissible or even necessary part of the genre. Adan, for example, seems to have a soft side which is perhaps more soft and loving than we might expect of a man who can be as evil as he can. Is this realistic? Who can really judge? Then we have the sex-hating tart-with-a-heart, Nora, who loves the chain-smoking priest, who loves her right back...and this contrasts with all of the rich sexuality of the gangsters' lives in the book... But again, is it just a little bit too black and white?In the end, it was a very enjoyable read. A masterpiece?

Winslow writes with a powerful style and describes very well his characters.

The book is kind of a treaty on recent story and drug trafficking in Mexico. It's extremely well documented and Winslow takes a clear stand in this respect. He is militant and convincing. The story is long and winding, but it ties up many recent realities linked to the cartel of Sinaloa, using fiction characters. You recognise bishops killed in airports, the famous narcotraficante El Rey de los Cielos, etc. His view of reality is clear, he knows that all efforts are useless and the bad guys can only win.But he suffers from something. Is this an American ailment? Is this years of a certain moral injected into all US citizens (and through movies into all the rest)? It happens that he feels the need to have positive characters. In a plot where nobody is good, where the DEA agent is constantly suffering because he's the root cause that many people have died, when the standard character has actively or passively suppressed a significant part of the entourage, you need to have good souls a bit corrupted by circumstances. To me this sounds like a dissonance and the book loses its fifth star. C'mon, Don!

Plenty of other fascinating characters come and go. No one gets off easy, everyone pays a heavy price.

These may seem petty quibbles but they also make me more skeptical of a writer.This is 3.5 stars for me but I am rating it 3 stars because of extreme violence which is not surprising considering the theme of the novel.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2016-reads", "around-the-world", "audiobooks", "crime-novel"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4113706781", "review_id": "4113706781", "date": "Jul 14, 2021", "rating": 4, "user_name": "paper0r0ss0", "user_url": "/user/show/4813706-paper0r0ss0", "text": "Nel cortile di casa centro-americano, gli USA fanno quello che vogliono, e' cosa risaputa.

There\u2019s always a war on something.\u201d That is the human condition I am afraid\u2026...\u201d Art Keller, San Diego, 1999Don Winslow begins THE POWER OF THE DOG with the murder of nineteen people by Mexican narco-traffickers in the nation\u2019s capital in 1997. This is a signal to the reader that the tale that is about to unravel will not be for the squeamish, but also it provides a hint of what is to come. In addition, it reflects how the drug trade operates, and it feels extremely contemporary. If you choose to continue, Winslow will take you on an unbelievable thirty ride inside American law enforcement and narco traffickers as the drug trade in South and Central America is presented in a brutal fashion.Winslow\u2019s protagonist, Art Keller, is a DEA agent who had moved over to the agency from the CIA with a background in the Phoenix (assassination) Program during the Vietnam War. Keller\u2019s presence in the DEA is controversial as the agency dislikes what they perceive to be \u201cCIA Cowboys,\u201d that results in a consistent theme of shutting Keller out from DEA policies. Keller witnesses the murders of the men, women, and children, and blames himself for what has occurred because he had recruited the perpetrators of the murders, Adan Barrera.Winslow will turn the clock back to 1975 to provide context and a path to understanding for the reader by introducing Operation Condor, a plan to take down Don Pedro Aviles and his narco empire. The novel focuses on the Sinaloa cartel at the outset and a joint US-Mexican operation to destroy the poppy fields and Aviles\u2019 operation to take down the Mexican drug trade.Keller\u2019s background from growing up in the San Diego barrio without a father, his time in the CIA, and the attitude of DEA hire ups toward him help form his worldview. For Keller, his goals are clear and the government bureaucracies that seems to get in the way are just obstacles to overcome. When the DEA shuns him, he strikes up a relationship with the Barrera family; first with Adan and his brother Raul, then with their uncle, Miguel Angel Barrera (known as Tio) of the Sinaloa State Police. These relationships form the core of Winslow\u2019s narrative as Keller feels that Tio who he worked with to stop the drug trade used him as a means of taking out the Aviles network and create his own under the guise of the federacion. Keller works diligently to rectify that wrong and assuage his guilt because of the murders. However, since this is about Mexico and the narco trade they are not the only murders, and not the only examples of Keller\u2019s revenge, a major theme of the novel. Other themes include the narco civil wars between competing cartel factions, the corruption of the Mexican government, and the American obsession with anti-communism.From the outset Winslow fosters a narrative of distrust \u2013 who are the good guys? Winslow also manufactures a realism as he describes the drug trade that seems right from the front pages of current newspapers. His story line development is taught as he introduces people who seem very believable in the roles they are assigned. Characters like Tim Taylor, Keller\u2019s DEA boss; Bishop Jan Parada, whose life\u2019s work is to help the poor and believes in liberation theology; the Barreras; the Piccone Brothers, who add an Italian mob element to the story; John Hobbs, CIA Station Chief for Central America who oversaw US pseudo enforcement and cooperation with the Cartels; Salvatore Scachi, a Special Forces Colonel, CIA asset, made Mafia wise guy, and a participant in the Phoenix program in Vietnam; Fabian Martinez, a Tijuana narco wanna be; Obop and Sean Callan who emerge as focal characters in the Irish mob in New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen and assassination experts; and Nora Hayden, sometime prostitute, sometime mistress, sometime US intelligence source who are all fascinating keys in what Winslow is trying to convey. With a myriad of characters, the reader needs to pay close attention, particularly the juxtaposition of Keller and Anan Barreras as they begin as \u201cfriends,\u201d but the relationship rests on each using the other to achieve their agendas.Winslow has excellent command of history and he integrates important events to enhance his story. The discussion of the September 19, 1985 Mexican earthquake (8.0 on the Richter scale) that resulted in over 5000 deaths reflected the weakness of the Mexican government and emphasizes that apart from the US, the main source of aid would come from the Vatican and Narco bosses. The insights fostered by Winslow\u2019s discussion of the earthquake are important as it took pressure off the Cartel as Mexico City had to rebuild. Another important historical theme is the role of communism and American foreign policy to Central America. The Reagan administration was obsessed with the rise of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua fearing the spread of its socialist ideology throughout the region. Reagan did not want to see another Cuban model and supported the Contra movement to defeat the Sandinista\u2019s. The funding of the Contras would lead to the Iran-Contra affair later, but in 1985 the model was clear, the Mexican Trampoline where coke was flown up from Columbia to El Salvador, then transported to Mexico where it was shipped to Mafia bosses in the United States for distribution. The Mafia paid for the drugs with weapons and military hardware for the Contras with the full knowledge of the CIA. It is interesting that Barrera was funding Contra training camps in El Salvador for the CIA! The pseudo alliance between the CIA and the cartels to block leftist politicians and union leaders from achieving power is historically accurate. Winslow points to programs like \u201cRed Mist,\u201d that applied assassination as a means of getting rid of any opposition, ostensibly creating a Phoenix program for South and Central America, and Operation Cerberus, a conspiracy to equip, fund, and train the Contras through the sale of cocaine. Coordination involved hundreds of right-wing militias and their drug lord sponsors, a thousand army officers, a few hundred thousand troops, dozens of separate intelligence agencies, police forces, and the church. American funding allowed the militias to carry out their mission that would lead to Death Squads in El Salvador and Guatemala resulting in the death of over 200,000 people. Later, A disgusted President Bush finally withdrew US support for a program he was deeply involved with as Vice-President. It is also interesting how Winslow blends the approval of NAFTA by the US congress to help bring Mexico out of poverty, so the drug trade needed to be kept off the front pages.Winslow also takes the reader inside the cartels as they compete for \u201cmarket share,\u201d sources for product, and distribution networks. The narco kingpins try and make it sound like a normal capitalist enterprise, however the corruption, violence, intimidation, extortion, murder is all part of their business model. They own segments of the police, the justice system, cooperation of elements in the Catholic Church, and government powerbrokers as they bribe and coerce all components of society to achieve their ends. Throughout the book there are numerous plot shifts and alliances that seem to change at the whim of the characters. Each change is unpredictable and keeps the reader paying rapt attention. The bottom line is that these interactions are despicable and produce feelings of disgust with American intelligence operatives and the deals they make - though in their own minds their rationalizations are completely justified.Winslow has written a scary novel with a very believable scenario. It is thoughtful, well written, and eye opening for those who are unaware of the depth of the drug trade. For those who have become hooked on the subject matter, Winslow has written a sequel, THE CARTEL, with a third volume due out in February 2019, called THE FORCE.", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/20077965", "review_id": "20077965", "date": "Apr 13, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Drew", "user_url": "/user/show/819002-drew", "text": "This book is a far-reaching epic that covers over 25 years in the lives of numerous characters who start out having nothing to do with each other and in some cases never do encounter each other. The thing they have in common, the reason that this book tells all of their various stories, is the drug war. This is an ambitious chronicle of America's War On Drugs, beginning with a successful covert effort to take out Mexico's reigning druglord in the wake of the Vietnam War. At this point, the government assumes that Mexican drug trafficking is a thing of the past, and that they can concentrate their efforts on other countries in Latin America. Art Keller, an agent of the newly-formed DEA who, unlike most of the law enforcement types in the DEA, has a CIA background, thinks this train of thought is deeply flawed. As the book goes on, it will prove him right. But it's a long road from those opening scenes to the final climactic moment in which all that's been set up finally comes together, and the book takes its time getting there. We are given complicated portraits of many different characters in the meantime, from an Irish hitman from New York to a California prostitute to a left-wing archbishop in Guadalajara, all of whom play important roles in the plot. This book has less of a storyline than a complicated web, in which the paths of many different characters spread out and converge at various points. I don't really want to get heavily into describing the plot, as much for reasons of space as anything, but I will say that all of the characters are well-described and sympathetic, and all of their stories are equally gripping and enjoyable. What can be the toughest part, in fact, is deciding who to root for. Often, central characters who were at another point in the book friends are pitted against each other, and as both have been sympathetically described, the reader sympathizes with both. And this isn't the only complicating factor--making it even tougher to decide who to root for is that none of the characters in the book (with the possible exception of the left-wing archbishop) have clean hands. All of them do morally ambiguous or even outright terrible things at one point or another.And this brings us to the question of Don Winslow's overall goal here. As epic and ambitious as \"Power Of The Dog\" appears to be purely in terms of its goals as a novel, its scope is even wider and more ambitious than that. Put plainly, Winslow is using this fictional chronicle to tell the story of America's drug war, its various inconsistent motivations and covert actions, and explain exactly why all of the players involved in the struggle did what they did. While a non-fiction chronicle would be more trustworthy in terms of factual details, it's my opinion that \"The Power Of The Dog\" succeeds in communicating the complicated nature of the drug war, from both the American and Latin American government perspective and from that of the druglords themselves. Furthermore, it succeeds in making the various motivations of all involved clear and understandable. But as I said before, no one's hands are clean. I personally find the idea of America retaining an anti-Communist agenda in their covert interferences with government of various Latin American countries despicable, especially in light of its ramifications for the working class of those countries. On the other hand, knowing that left-wing revolutionary groups who did care about the workers and making sure they were treated justly often funded their efforts through the sale and distribution of cocaine and other drugs doesn't make me feel very good at all. And knowing that the CIA and other covert government agencies facilitated drug-dealing in the U.S. in order to make it easier to manipulate the political situation in Latin America is pretty appalling too. I know that these things happened from my various readings, but \"Power Of The Dog\"s fictional narrative helps bring it home for me in a way that no footnoted statement in a Wikipedia entry can.I've written about Don Winslow before, concerning his excellent novel \"California Fire And Life\", from 1999. That book still seems great to me having read \"The Power Of The Dog\", but \"Power Of The Dog\" is obviously on a completely different level than is \"California Fire And Life\". It's Winslow's followup to that book, but there was a 6 year period inbetween the publishing of the two books, and it's understandable in light of just how much work must have gone into the writing of \"Power Of The Dog\". Fortunately, it was effort well spent, and anyone who reads this book will come away having gotten the kind of reading experience that one always hopes for but is rarely fortunate enough to find. It's the kind of book that, when one puts it down, makes picking up any other book seem trivial. \"The Power Of The Dog\" demands a decent amount of quiet reflection before moving on, and may very well change the way you look at America's War On Drugs. It will definitely be one of the better reading experiences you'll have, this or any year. If you haven't read it, do so now.

He writes about the evil of the drug wars and the US government plots to disarm regimes it doesn't like, undertaken without the support of the law and certainly without the support of the people.Each of Winslow's characters struggle with an evil side, and with decisions--some small, some not--that reject moral boudaries and where some struggle until the end of the book to make up for the evil they've created. Even Art Keller, the central figure, who we want to believe is a good man is not. As Winslow makes it clear in all his works, if you are determined to eradicate evil, you become evil yourself. It is only Father Juan who escapes this, and to some extent, Nora, the high end escort, who loves Father Juan unequivocally in a platonic sense, who seem to escape judgment, although Nora has her moments when she, too, is unlovable and evil. Winslow manages, though, to keep us in constant search of redemption, and, in a meaningful way, this work has a deeply spiritual message. It also keeps the struggle between good and evil front and center.Winslow's work is so well researched that the fictions become believable. In my view, he has it all as a writer.

Und genau da beginnen f\u00fcr mich auch schon die Probleme: Winslow hat unglaublich viele Fakten zusammengetragen und war offensichtlichen von dem Wunsch getrieben sie m\u00f6glichst alle unterzubringen, was leider dazu gef\u00fchrt hat dass man sich in vielen Kapiteln eher vorkommt als w\u00fcrde man ein Sachbuch lesen und keinen Roman. Zugegeben, ein durchaus interessantes Sachbuch, aber viel zu oft wird sichtbar gewollt eine Verbindung zur Handlung oder einen der beteiligten (sehr vielen) Charakteren konstruiert, nur um dann eine seitenlange Geschichtsstunde abzuhalten. Das kann man so machen, aber \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig geschickt wirken diese Passagen nicht in den Roman eingeflochten. Daher vermute ich sehr stark dass Winslows andere, k\u00fcrzere Werke, in denen er einfach nur eine spannende Geschichte erz\u00e4hlt zumindest mir deutlich besser gefallen k\u00f6nnten. Denn spannend schreiben kann er! Die andere gro\u00dfe Schw\u00e4che sind leider die Charaktere. Es sind einfach zu viele, und die meisten davon bleiben bis zum Schluss ziemlich eindimensional (wenn ich mich selbst auf Seite 400 zun\u00e4chst nicht erinnern kann wer eine bestimmte Person jetzt eigentlich noch war, ist das kein gutes Zeichen \u2026). Die vier zentralen Hauptcharaktere haben mir am Ende aber deutlich vor Augen gestanden, ein weiteres Indiz daf\u00fcr dass der Autor sich mit der Komplexit\u00e4t der Materie ein wenig \u00fcbernommen hat. Da das Buch aber nahezu \u00fcberall auf einhellige Begeisterung st\u00f6\u00dft scheine ich das alles ein wenig zu kritisch zu sehen und w\u00fcrde daher auch niemandem abraten \u201eTage der Toten\u201c zu lesen. Einen spannenden Thriller bekommt man allemal, und zwischendurch etwas zu lernen hat schlie\u00dflich auch noch nie geschadet \u2026 3,5 Sterne ", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2773751976", "review_id": "2773751976", "date": "Dec 10, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "K", "user_url": "/user/show/7511911-k", "text": "Gritty.

This is a mighty lengthy book and at times, I thought, one that could have been trimmed a bit. Nevertheless, if you're willing to maintain focus and keep characters straight, the pay-off is worth the ride.A historical fiction about the Narcotrafficantes in Mexico, the DEA's \"war on drugs\" and the futility therein-- that's the overview of what this is about. But the real beauty of this work isn't this tried and true plot concept. Rather, the beauty of Winslow's writing lies in his characters:DEA agent Art Keller is determined to bring down the Barrera brothers and their drug empire. He becomes obsessed with the family when he loses a fellow agent to them, and vows vengeance, at any and all costs. Ad\u00e1n and Raul Barrera are studies in opposites, one cerebral, the other cruel in his physicality. Both bring something to the table and rise in power to essentially rule the Mexican channel for drugs into the U.S. Nora Hayden is a stunningly beautiful teenager who becomes a high-class hooker and ultimately plays an essential role in the story. She is jaded beyond the pale, yet harbors an abiding love for:Father Parada, an incorruptible Catholic priest who gains power in order to do good for the people. And we meet an Irish kid named Callan, who becomes a very feared and skilled mob hitman in NYC, but manages to become involved in the story unfolding in Mexico nonetheless.An unusual group of main characters, whom WInslow binds together in the woven fabric of Mexico's drug world. The story will take you from the streets of New York City to Mexico City and Tijuana to the jungles of Central America, and you'll learn more than you ever wanted about covert operations, back-door political deals, the \"war on drugs\" and the real, gritty world of international drug trade, power, money, and mayhem.

There are neither purely good guys, nor completely evil bad guys. It seems like Winslow covered everything from family to feigned friendship, from faith to agnosticism, from obsession to oppression. The War on Drugs plays a major role in this novel, as does the U.S.'s use of that travesty and failure to maintain a large distance from Communist countries: in other words, to keep them from moving in right next door. Winslow's characters are both likeable and not. Some, I wanted to side with initially, only to rethink my loyalty later. It really is a great ride through the psychology of trying to reach a goal that may be, when all is said and done, unobtainable: e.g. the War on Drugs. It's like a war against dirt, it is never-ending and demands constant vigilance (which, if truth be told, is a waste of time, i.e. dirt will win). I'm not making a judgment on drugs (or on dirt, for that matter), but on the ways in which the U.S. has \"tried\" to stop the flow of those drugs. Billions of dollars have been spent, and many of those billions have ended up in the pockets of the heads of the very drug cartels that were the targets of this fiasco called a war.Winslow does an excellent job of presenting the history necessary to tell his story without dragging in so much as to make it a boring read. He uses what is necessary, leaves out what isn't. At the very least, this novel has made me think about the U.S. relations with our neighbors to the south in North, Central and South America. Was the War on Drugs really just a way for the U.S. to keep Communists from moving in right next door? Did the U.S. supply anti-communist fighters, who also happened to be part of the huge flow of drugs into and money out of the U.S.?

It is the violent and very disturbing story of the war on drugs, the one we have been fighting for many years and never win. These three novels explain the many reasons why despite millions of dollars spent, things never change. There are too many people making money, too many politicians taking advantage of the situation to meet their own ends and no sensible, cohesive and well-coordinated plan among the many competing agencies tasked with solving the problem. All the efforts made are time limited, affected by whatever officials and political party is in power, how well the agencies tasked with the mandate share information and work together and how well the justice system cooperates to charge those who are guilty, take them to trial and incarcerate those guilty for the prison terms for which they were sentenced. This story, which evolves over decades, reveals the amount of corruption, deal making and subterfuge that exist at all levels in government, the justice system and the military that ensures the war is never won. It is too profitable for too many people. So they dabble at the edges with code named operations that may achieve some small success, but whatever parts of the system that grows, transports and distributes drugs is affected by their efforts, is soon put back in operation. If a drug leader is captured, the vacuum created is quickly filled with someone ready to take the positions of the one who fell. The drug business is a dangerous game, but its allure so great and the profits so large that thousands are ready to risk their lives to be a part of it, especially those who are poor and have little to look forward to in life. This story begins in the 1970s and ends in May of 2004, played out against the background of cocaine trafficked through what is known as the \u201cMexican Trampoline\u201d, the route from Mendellin to Honduras to Mexico and then to the States. There are three separate plot lines beginning in different geographical locations that ultimately converge in Mexico. Special Agent Art Keller is with the DEA, a former CIA operative and a veteran of Vietnam who took part in the takedown of the Vietcong leadership. During that tour he saw much he wishes he hadn\u2019t and has since tried to forget but many ugly things remain stuck in his memory. Keller is half Mexican and half American. He grew up in a barrio in San Diego, saw what drugs did to the people in his neighborhood and is determined to help get them off the street. The combination of his American citizenship and his fluency in Spanish has landed him on assignment in Culiac\u00e1n Mexico where he ends up in a difficult relationship with his boss Tim Taylor. He ultimately aligns himself with Miguel Angel Barrera (AKA Tio), an influential officer with the Mexican Sinaloa State Police and the two work together to burn the poppy fields of the reigning drug lord Don Pedro Aviles (El Patron). It is only later that Keller realizes that Tio Barrera had used him to eradicate his opposition in the drug world and laid a clear path to replace Don Pedro as the head of the Federation. He ruthlessly eradicates his competition and uses his nephews Adan and Raul to help maintain control over his empire. The cousins are very different, Adan is the studious business man comfortable with numbers and Raul the ruthless one who recruits the kids off the streets, settles scores with violence and keeps everyone in line. It is not long before Tio Barrera is a powerful, wealthy man, feared by everyone.Sean Callan, a poor Irish teenager living in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in New York City is forced to kill a thug who threatened his best friend and Callan is now a teenage killer on the run. He carries out a number of brutal killings, evolves into a stone cold hit man and aligns himself with the mob. The names of his buddies are classic names that draw a smile, names like Big Peaches, Little Peaches, Johnny Boy and Big Paulie. Callan eventually ends up doing contract assassinations for both the Barreras and the U.S. government. Nora Hayden is a beautiful and intelligent woman from California who has learned how to use her body to get what she wants from men. She is recruited by Hayley Saxon an ambitious woman who is building up her business as a madam with a client base that targets rich and powerful men. Hayley has taught Nora all she needs to know to be a high class call girl and Nora saves her money, keeps in shape and enjoys living her life servicing men who would do almost anything to sample her charms. Hayley supplies girls for both the Barreras and the mob and thus a plot path is created to connect Adan Barrera, Art Keller and Sean Callan. Hayley becomes Adan Barrera\u2019s mistress while at the same time, after years of having men use her, develops a platonic relationship with Archbishop Juan Parada, a man who tries his best to support the poor in Mexico. Keller tries to exploit her affection for Parada to get at the Berraras. Although this is a novel of fiction, readers will recognize many references to actual people and events. Some have different names but their identity is blatantly obvious. Winslow's descriptions of the drug trafficking world also prove authentic. He describes how drug lords protect their profits and their way of life through torture, mass executions, bribery and corruption. His lays out how the Mexican cartels, the New York mafia, the CIA, DEA, prostitutes and hired killers all form a vast network that provides the foundation for drug trafficking. He spells out the duplicitous relationship between the cartels and the police and how these corrupt entities support and fuel each other\u2019s activities. And he lays out with shocking clarity how the drug wars have become linked with covert efforts to halt the spread of communism in Latin America as one government agency\u2019s efforts are nullified by another. The DEA\u2019s efforts are sabotaged by CIA operations in South America as the US government secretly provides Contra rebels with training and support, helps them smuggle guns and drugs to finance their work and ultimately helps the cartels deliver drugs across the border to America.Winslow does not skimp on sharing the shocking torture and violence that are a part of the drug world and how thugs cut off limbs, behead their enemies and slaughter entire families. These gory atrocities are not just payback for perceived wrongs. The mutilated dead bodies are left on public display and are an important way the narcos control their enemies and the local population.This novel is big (over 550 pages) and has a large cast of characters. Although some have only a short time on these pages, each has a distinct personality. It is a challenge to keep track of them all especially with their Spanish names and nicknames. This story can be complicated to follow at times, but presents a piece of realistic fiction that reveals the absolute absurdity of the war on drugs. The story moves between moments of shocking revelations, to moments of terror, sadness and grief, but it all combines to take readers on a terrific ride.

I was daydreaming one day, getting all reminiscent of the trivial, but on second guess very enjoyable Boone Daniels books \u2013 thoughts of which led me to believe that I should read more by Don Winslow.  In theory, this is a wild ride: This novel throws you right into a world of betrayal and corruption, from New York and Mexico City over to the jungles of Central America. We meet broken and messed-up characters, from a high-class hooker to an obsessive DEA agent over to a powerful Catholic priest. Turns out I just don't care about money and drugs that much. I can't blame Winslow for this. The tone, the narration, the characters \u2013 all that felt in line with the world depicted. Everything felt violent, dangerous, calculated. In a way, it's easy to compare with a high-budget action thriller: it's a wild ride, it's a fast one, too, but then they never really stick to your memory, do they? (At least not in mine, but again, high-budget action thriller are also not my favourite genre when it comes to films).There's also a side to this book that makes you think. When you're not busy jumping from one brutal scene to the next, you've got some time to think about how far this actually derives from the real-world War on Drugs that the US government has been campaigning for for decades now. Winslow uses this as an opportunity to comment on the situation, even though I'm not entirely sure what he's criticising? Occasionally it felt like it wasn't the actual drug use he has a problem with, but the interdiction. But this is a problem that will have to find another platform to be discussed.

(Scottish author Malcolm Mackay clearly went to school on Winslow's customary rat-a-tat style for his gangster noirs.)In this mammoth (in size and in scope) odyssey of the Mexican-American drug war, whose sequel The Cartel I'd already read, Winslow wears all of those influences on his sleeve, but they're so well synthesized that the result is something that feels original. It also feels like Winslow owns this territory so authoritatively that anyone else who tries to cover it would have to reckon with these books first, much the way anyone who writes a mob book is doing so in Puzo's shadow.I wasn't as enamored with his big cop novel The Force as other folks (witness its 4.11 rating on Goodreads) because its trajectory felt derivative (Denny Malone = Vic Mackey); in these drug war thrillers, Winslow is almost writing the history of our failed four-decade War on Drugs with more acuity and resonance than any nonfiction to date.

Lying fetal inside a sheet of black plastic in a ditch off a dirt road in Badiraguato. His dried blood is caked flat black against the shiny black plastic . The black blindfold is still around his eyes. Otherwise he's naked, and Art can see the open wounds where they jammed an ice pick through his flesh and scraped his bones, the electrode burns, the signs of anal rape, the needle marks from the lidocaine and heroin injections up and down his arms.  What have I done? Art asks himself. Why did someone else have to pay for my obsession? I'm sorry, Ernie. I'm so goddamn sorry...\"Art Keller is a Mexican American, born and raised in the barrios of Southern California. He was recruited out of college by the CIA and after a stint in Vietnam, he wanted out. Art wanted to do something good, be a real force, and hopefully wipe away the blood and stench of what happened in Vietnam. What he becomes is a DEA agent working in Mexico. At first it's pretty boring. No one will speak with him. He isn't trusted by the Cartels, to them he has Narco written all over him. He isn't trusted by the DEA, his time as a CIA spook has them questioning how much of a real cop he is. But a chance encounter with the Barrera brothers gives him an in with what would become, the most powerful drug cartel in Mexico.\"...Would you happen to have an extra cigarette?' the priest asks. 'I don't smoke.' 'Puritan.' 'It'll kill you,' Art says. 'Everything I like will kill me,' the priest answers. 'I smoke, I drink, I eat too much. Sexual sublimation, I suppose. I'm Bishop Parada. You can call me Father Juan.' 'You're a madman, Father Juan.' 'Christ needs madmen,' Parada says, standing up and dusting himself off. He looks around and smiles. 'And the village is still here, isn't it?' Yeah, Art thinks, because the gomeros started shooting. 'Do you have a name?' the priest asks. 'Art Keller.' He offers his hand. Parada takes it asking, 'Why are you down here burning my country, Art Keller?' 'Like I said, it's-' 'Your job, ' Parada says. 'Shitty job, Arturo...\"Bishop Parada was born in Texas, on the United States side of the border, to migrant workers. What many Americans would refer to as illegals. Parada returned to Mexico and joined the priesthood, rising up the ranks to become a Bishop. He is well acquainted with the violence and corruption of the country he loves. He has been priest to politicians, drug runners and villagers alike. He has a calling to serve the poor and oppressed and in Mexico, he has found so many. Parada will unwittingly become a player in the rise to power of Adan Barrera and the war between Keller and Barrera. A part that will end in blood.\"...Fabian lowers his head and lifts his foot and plants it right on the crucifix on Parada's chest and kicks, sending the priest sprawling back against the car, and the Fabian lifts the gun's barrel again and sends fifteen bullets smashing into Parada's chest.

Adan Barrera. It is also the story of a lone DEA agent who will do anything to bring Barrera to justice. But in the end it will be what Art Keller is actually willing to sacrifice that will cost him the most. The Power of the Dog is a force to be reckoned with. This is the type of novel so rooted in the truth that you will forget you are reading fiction because, truthfully you are not. It is bloody and brutal and pulls no punches. That is good because this is a subject matter that demands stark honesty. The violence of the drug trade that comes into the United States is stained on everyone's hands. From the dealers to the cops to the governments to the consumer. We are all corruptible. Winslow is writing a documentary of a time and place that is hiding behind the entertainment of a novel. Maybe because that is the only way we can accept it. We need this to be fiction. We need to believe that these acts are the imaginings of a lone author. But they are not. They are the truths of our addictions and the cost of those weaknesses. Keller is an amazing and complex character. A man who strays so often from what he once thought to be right and good in his quest to stop the drug trade. But so is Adan Barrera, a man so horrible and cruel but yet the reader will identify quite often with his desire to keep what is his. To protect those that he feels are entrusted to him. To his sense of love and loyalty. In the end, the fine line between the two is too often muddied and blurred.Winslow does that fine of a job as a storyteller and The Power of Dog is that good of a book.A really powerful and good read and not to be missed!", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2401302940", "review_id": "2401302940", "date": "May 24, 2018", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Abby Slater- Fairbrother", "user_url": "/user/show/40142516-abby-slater--fairbrother", "text": "I don\u2019t quite know where to begin with this review. The novel is so in-depth and detailed about the cartel lifestyle and Mexican/American political systems that enabled it. It that it is incredibly hard to breakdown. The characterisation is brilliant, the author slowly builds the characters up as the plot unravels. You are left under no illusion what an immensely tough job it must be to enforce DEA law and attempt to stop the cartel\u2019s flow of drugs. Not only are the police facing a criminal network that spans the globe and is savage and violent in its approach. But they also face dirty cops, bribed officials and people who would put themselves above the good of the country and its citizens. \u2018A lot of money goes into bribes. silver or lead\u2019The prologue opens in El Sauzal, Mexico 1997. Art Keller our protagonist and US operative is at the scene of a violent and bloody murder. 19 bodies lay slain, including a mother and baby. The death toll is 10 men, 3 women and 6 children. The victims were lined up against the patio wall and shot, execution style. Some of the family members show signs of torture, leading the cops to believe this is gang/cartel related. One lone victim remains, who was forced to watch the violence take place. The novel goes on to describe the various methods of torture for crime committed. For example, traitors are shot in the back of the head and informers in the mouth. Life is the cartel is far from easy. \u2018El poder del perro\u2019 \u2013 The power of the dogFrom the start the novel has a violent and explosive opening. However, the novel does go on to detail various areas of Mexico, who is affected by the cartel trade which includes the poor and just trying to get by citizens. But it also covers the policing, how a multidisciplinary team approach is desperately needed. But no one trust each other. Art Keller is new to Mexico at the opening of the novel, but the end he is accustomed to the harsh way of life/death the cartels live by. At the beginning he is suffering flashbacks from his tour in Vietnam. I wondered myself, which would be worse war or the war on drugs?The DEA has been in operation 2yrs and Nixon has recently declared his \u2018war on drugs\u2019 stance. This is as the same time Art find himself recruited from the CIA to the DEA. Art is an experienced soldier, but I believe at the beginning he was na\u00efve at just how integrated the cartel structure is into everyday life. His boss Tim Taylor hates him, and he is isolated and alone in and new to Mexico. This is when he first meets Adan Barrera. . . \u2018Years later, Art would have given anything in the world to have just killed Adan Barrera on the spot\u2019 \u2018A partnership made in hell\u2019 \u2013 Art Keller & Tio Barrera There are a wealth of characters from Father Juan to Nora Hayden, it would be impossible for me to break down all the details of who fits into the plot and where, just know that each individual mentioned is relevant and they all play a part no matter how big or small in the formation of a divide. Which will sit Art on one side of the fence and the cartel on another. Art is also dealing with his own new marriage and personal problems. He is a complex character and there is so much more to Art than first meets the eye. \u2018The only redemption for having a bad father is being a good one\u2019 Art has adapted the motto YOYO aka you\u2019re on your own. A motto that when dealing with the cartel will serve him well, as you never know who you can trust. When Art\u2019s colleague Ernie Hidalgo goes missing, all hell breaks loose the DEA will stop at nothing to return one of their own. \u201cIf I have to. . . I\u2019ll start a fucking war\u201d \u2013 Art Keller Adan Barrera\u2019s character also evolves. He is quite the strategist and manages to ensure he is top-dog of the cartel empire. But how long can that last for? And how quickly can you be taken down or killed?Adan also has a daughter that suffers a rare genetic condition. He personally feels responsible for this and it causes a huge rift in his marriage. With both him and his wife, ready to accept full responsibility for the condition. \u2018neither god nor science can help his daughter\u2019 The novel goes on to explain Adan\u2019s rise within the organised infrastructure of the cartel drug trade. \u2018Adan Barrera has reinvented the drug business\u2019 The cartels are comfortable with the situation of buying the very police sent to stop them, they see it as a franchise, a business expense. \u2018Just look the other way, be someplace else, see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil and the monthly payment will be there in full and on time\u2019 The cartel trade runs into profits of $8million a WEEK, yes that is a WEEK!!!!!! It is easy to see that every man, woman or child just has a price tag attached. Except one man, Art Keller can not be bought and will not be put on the pay roll. It just might be his downfall and he knows it. . . \u2018He\u2019s only sure that either he will kill Adan or Adan will kill him, and those are the only two ways this thing can end\u2019 \u2013 Art Keller This novel has a deeply layered plot, that covers politics, corruption, flow of drugs, cartel wars, deception and violence. The last 20% is very intense and sets the scene perfectly for the next novel in the series The Cartel. Which I already have sat on my tbr pile. A fantastic insight into the real \u2018war on drugs\u2019.

You live as the good guys the bad guys and the people in between that are casualties of the drug war. This looks at both sides like I have never read before, it shows the good guys having to cross lines they never thought they could cross and the bad guys crossing those lines to keep what they have. There's a scene that will leave you floored as a bad guy does the unthinkable to take down a rival, think Red Wedding from Game of Thrones. This book goes through 3 decades of drug traffic starting in the 1970's to the 2000's, from Mexico, Columbia and the United States. This is the first in the Power of the Dog Series, it continues in The Cartel, and in The Border. I have read the Cartel and it is just as excellent as The Power of the Dog. Winslow has this writing style that feels so real, he can take you to the past in a blink of an eye while wrapping up the narrative. His writing style reminds me of Mario Puzo meets James Ellroy. The fiction blends perfectly with real events, making the novel feel so real. This is My third Don Winslow novel, and I have been blown away each time. I t was just announced that the novel The Force will star Matt Damon and be directed by James Mangold, who just directed Damon in Ford v Ferrari. Winslow has previously had the Secret Life of Bobby Z and The Savages who both starred John Travolta.The Plot: Art Kellar a soldier in Vietnam War takes a job at a newly formed organization the DEA. His job is to stop the flow of heroin from Mexico to the US. Art makes friends with the Tio Barrera a local cop with a lot of influence and his nephews Adan and Raul. Adan and Kellar are fast friends and the reason he now has the influence he has in the organization. Kellar and the Barrera's take down the drug kingpin of heroin in Mexico. Which the DEA calls job well done. Only the Barrera's had an ulterior motive to take up the distribution and use it for a cheaper new drug cocaine. Art Kellar has to convince his superiors of the new drug and new power players, Kellar feels responsible for giving power. Kellar dedicates his life to stopping his former friends the Barrera's. It will take a Priest, a prostitute, and a member of the Irish mob to all play a part.What I Liked: The history in intertwined in the novel elevates it to the next level. The way the CIA plays both sides and the motive that is given. The ups and downs of good guys to bad guys. This side characters that are explored and make sense when you see the whole puzzle in how they fit into it. The way people are described really sets them apart. There's easily over fifty characters and I was never once confused on who they were and who's side they were on. The twist and turns of people flipping, of plans not working out, of people having hidden agendas, and of how connected they really are, is what makes this novel so great. The story flows so seamlessly despite how complex the storyline is. Nora and Callan's arcs are my favorites to good supporting character's that are more than they seem. The bridge scene is, the scene that will stick with me for a while, it's tension filled, it's a do or die moment for one character, and it was so horrific, so shocking, that it made me cry with grief. This is the Red Wedding moment in Game of Thrones.What I Disliked: Understanding of Columbian politics, I feel like I need a whole book to understand Columbian politics, and the book takes a shot at it and I still came away confused. I feel like it is more of the complexity of the situation than the explaining of it, it didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the book, and I still took a lot a way from it. Recommendation: The Power of the Dog is a book that feels like a great gangster movie as your reading it. There's too many trigger warning's too list, If you enjoy gangster movies or Game of Thrones the series or the books then you can handle the brutality of this. This is my third novel by Don Winslow and it will not be my last. I read the Cartel first before knowing it was a series and was blown away and not too lost, I now plan on rereading it, to get the impact of everything that happened before, and eventually read the Border the newest entry in the series. The Power of the Dog by Don Winslow gets the same score as the Cartel 5 out of 5 stars.

This is noir writ large, but it\u2019s also social commentary. It\u2019s an experiment in large-scale political thriller, but it comes with a conscience. At its best it can almost stand next to James Ellroy or even \u2013 though, of course not quite \u2013 Roberto Bolano.One feature of noir is that it cuts out the fluff. Going back to Hammett and Chandler, the noir voice pares away extra words. It refuses to give you the extra padding that can insulate you from the despair it\u2019s navigating.That makes it tough for noir to be long. The best of it starts a story, moves it along, and then wraps it up quickly. So, outside of Ellroy, you rarely see anything as intertwined and ambitious as this. It spans close to a decade, two sides of the border, and seven or eight central characters.That would be enough to make this a powerful work within the genre, but it goes a lot farther than that too. Unlike some strains of noir \u2013 again, Ellroy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t let its exploration of nihilism drive it to conservative politics. Instead, after it strips away so much, it still finds glimmers of a potential good. U.S. anti-drug agent Art Keller may get corrupted into actions that he regrets, actions that cost him much of what he loves, but he maintains a sense of what it means to bring the Mexican drug agents down.We watch as Art begins by cultivating some young cocaine dealers, following their leads to take out their rivals and then establishing himself as a rising figure within the D.E.A. Those young dealers rise as well, one of them in particular a Pablo Escobar level international boss. Throw in a young Irish gangster who gets caught in international intrigue, a beauty who becomes a high-class courtesan, a priest who becomes an Archbishop like Romero, and several others who appear and re-appear in a weave of narrative threads.In the course of the different stories separating and coming together, we see endless brutality. (Stay away, far away, if blood makes you queasy.) At times, it\u2019s as concussive as 2666, and to similar purpose, if not to the same soaring desperate end. The constant reports of violence, particularly against the powerless, horrify, then numb, then anger, and finally rise to a sense that someone somewhere has to do something about it. The result is a novel that, while ultimately adhering to the conventions of the genre, pushes against them as well. It does invite us to care about particular characters in a way that Bolano resists, but it also reminds us that there\u2019s no promise that virtue will win. I don\u2019t want to risk spoilers, but evil \u2013 known her as \u201cthe power of the dog\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t something that just goes away. People with the impulse to help others can get corrupted, and those who seem heartless can, having had enough, push back.But there\u2019s a tar baby quality as well. Everyone who touches the evil gets infected by it, even those who think they\u2019re resisting. And, given that the crimes here (often indistinguishable from the efforts to stop those crimes) are often the work of U.S. government-linked forces, even those of us just reading it are guilty as well.This is the first in a trilogy, and I have begun the second. Still, this one stands satisfyingly alone.

So grand in scope, so exhaustively researched, and so authoritative in its delivery of the facts, and comparisons or analogies are strained. But for a starter, consider a role up of \"Traffic\", \"The Godfather\", and \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\". Winslow manages to demystify the shady politics and clandestine operations of Nicaragua and the Sandanistas and the Iran-Contra affair, the 1994 assassination of Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Colosio, NAFTA and others in enough detail to qualify as a docudrama, while the unspeakable brutality, depravity, and evil that travels alongside the drug trade is, well, plainly spoken. Winslow weaves tight story lines from Mexico's deserts and poppy fields to the Tijuana/San Diego borderland battlegrounds to New York City's Hell's Kitchen and Bensonhurst. His characters are much too real to be expected between the pages of pop fiction - all too believable in their flaws, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and failures.In the end, it would not be giving anything away to say that the vaunted war on drugs is ultimately a war of futility. Drugs pour into the US in ever-greater quantities while drug lords get richer and the American taxpayer pours increasingly more money to fund corrupt politicians and dubious strategies. Notwithstanding, \"The Power of the Dog\" is a powerful and unapologetic tale of bitter fatalism, of redemption that rings ultimately hollow. If you are squeamish, or intend to keep naive delusions of our \"noble\" fight against drugs intact, this is probably not the book for you. But for what is bound to become a classic, plumbing the depths of evil in this dark history we'd probably all prefer to ignore, you simply must read this novel.", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4287188618", "review_id": "4287188618", "date": "Oct 28, 2021", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Greg Zimmerman", "user_url": "/user/show/41665-greg-zimmerman", "text": "Damn.

R\u00e9paration effectu\u00e9e avec ma critique ci-dessous pour ce pav\u00e9 (un peu plus de 800 pages), lui aussi, mais on ne s'en rend pas compte.L'auteur : Don Winslow est n\u00e9 en 1953. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs m\u00e9tiers, il a \u00e9crit au moins dix-sept romans, des best-sellers, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 traduits dans une vingtaine de langues. A pr\u00e9sent, il vit \u00e0 San Diego, \u00ab le paradis du surf. \u00bbLe livre : un thriller que certaines \u00e2mes sensibles ne supporteraient pas (eh oui, il y en a et c'est leur droit comme c'est notre droit, \u00e0 nous lecteurs qui aimons le genre, nous les amateurs de sensations fortes \u2013 ceux qui veulent aborder d'immenses probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s, notamment, par la drogue. Et cela existe malheureusement : rien ne sert de se voiler la face).Il existe des pays, comme le Mexique (par exemple), o\u00f9 elle fait des ravages et o\u00f9 elle est reine. Mauvaise r\u00e9putation. Mais qui dit drogue, dit cartels et ils sont nombreux, puissants, tous ennemis les uns des autres. C'est ce que Don Winslow nous raconte avec force d\u00e9tails et descriptions scabreuses.Ce qui frappe d'abord sur la couverture, c'est la remarque de James Ellroy : \u00ab Le plus grand roman sur la drogue jamais \u00e9crit. Une vision grandiose de l'Enfer et de toutes les folies qui le bordent. \u00bbSi ce n'est pas un bel hommage que celui-ci, de la part d'un tel \u00e9crivain que James Ellroy, c\u2018est une critique en elle-m\u00eame et je vais essayer de rajouter quelques phrases.On d\u00e9couvre (hum, hum ! Comme si on ne le savait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0), le trafic de drogue entre le Mexique et les \u00c9tats-Unis, avec l'histoire de Art Keller, surnomm\u00e9 : \u00ab le seigneur de la fronti\u00e8re \u00bb, (agent de la DEA), tandis que Ad\u00e1n Barrera et Ra\u00fal Barrera, eux, sont surnomm\u00e9s : \u00ab les seigneurs des cieux. \u00bb. Ad\u00e1n, lui, un \u00ab seigneur de la drogue \u00bb, a une vie familiale difficile car sa fille est handicap\u00e9e mais il ne veut que son bien. Petite touche de tendresse. Or, Ad\u00e1n r\u00e8gne sur les sicarios.L'\u00e9glise est pr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement avec \u00ab l'archev\u00eaque rouge \u00bb, Juan Parada et une autre personne est \u00e0 remarquer : il s'agit d'une prostitu\u00e9e, Nora Hayden, tr\u00e8s intelligente et qui tient une bonne place.Mais Don Winslow ne s'est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 nous offrir un gigantesque travail \u00ab documentaire \u00bb. Page apr\u00e8s page, on d\u00e9couvre toutes les horreurs commises par les narcotrafiquants, les hommes de main des \u00ab grands de la p\u00e8gre \u00bb - on d\u00e9couvre le nombre tellement important de ces cartels. Ce sont donc les agissements d'un agent de la DEA \u2013 ceux d'un gangster d'origine irlandaise \u2013 l'intervention d'une prostitu\u00e9e, ainsi que celle d'un pr\u00eatre mexicain \u2013 de la CIA \u2026. bref, autant dire tellement de personnages aussi vari\u00e9s les uns que les autres qu'il est fort difficile de les d\u00e9tailler.Chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment est important et contribue \u00e0 constituer cet ouvrage dont on tourne les pages les unes apr\u00e8s les autres. On apprend ainsi cette terrible guerre des cartels que l'on continuera \u00e0 lire dans \u00ab Cartel \u00bb (la suite).On assiste \u00e0 une plong\u00e9e passionnante mais terrible dans ce milieu de narcotrafiquants qui se livrent \u00e0 une guerre sans merci. Des t\u00eates tombent (au sens propre comme au figur\u00e9) \u2013 si certains flics sont incorruptibles, d'autres le sont moins : \u00ab money is money \u00bb, et les p\u00e9tarades se font entendre pour un oui ou pour un non. Non seulement \u00e7a flingue mais c'est \u00e9galement fait par erreur. On s'est tromp\u00e9 de cible, alors tant pis, un de plus ou un de mois, dans le tas, \u00e7a passera.Le rythme est tr\u00e9pidant \u2013 pas un moment de r\u00e9pit, ce qui tient le lecteur en haleine.On peut lire ceci (entre autres que j'ai relev\u00e9 du titre \u00ab La griffe du chien \u00bb \u00ab El poder del perro \u00bb : \u00ab Art appuie sur la d\u00e9tente.

As per usual, I went to Goodreads to add it to my To-Read pile (that will still be there after I die, it's so large) and discovered that it was third in a series. We all know my trouble with starting a series in the wrong spot.I did my research and ended up getting book #1, The Power of the Dog, from the library. Work is making it increasingly difficult to just sit down and read. My mind wanders, thinking about all the work I should be doing, instead of relaxing and escaping reality. The Power of the Dog caught me right from the start and tried so hard to make me just sit and read. It turns out, I had to read this in fleeting moments, mostly waiting in waiting rooms for appointments or kept in my car and purse for quiet minutes before a dinner or stuck in traffic. Any chance I had, I read.\u201cDeliver my soul from the sword; my love from the power of the dog. Psalms 22:20\u201d I would be incorrect to say this was just a novel about the Mexican drug cartel. It's Irish Mafia, Russians, American DEA, Italian Mafia, Hookers, Priests, drug lords, Columbians and the American government out for their own agenda. It's every-fricking-thing.It's Art Keller. A Mexican-American kid grown up to be DEA. It's Adan Barrera and his brother, Raul. Their uncle is in charge of Operation Condor, in 1975, that destroys the poppy fields in Mexico, taking out the main source of heroin. Tio Barrera delivers the main drug lord to the Americans and makes it appear the operation was a success. But Tio has other plans. Instead of heroin, he brings together a federation of drug dealers (suppliers, soon to be millionaires), including his nephews, to start producing crack cocaine and distributing it across the border to the US. Two thousand miles of border is split up so every area is covered. And soon, America has a crack epidemic. In New York, we have O-Bop and Callan, two Irish kids, who run into the wrong side of the Irish mob. The Italian Mafia wants to start bringing in crack to the area to make more money and run into the Irish kids. Callan turns out to be a killer...literally. O-Bop comes along for the ride but it's really Callan's show. The Italians start using and investing in the kids.The book moves along the years to follow all of the players, and there are a lot. Starting off in 1975 and ending 2004, we cover a lot of, often bloody, ground. I was amazed at the detail, not necessarily the gory details. The human beings caught up in events they really don't want to participate in, trying to get away from the mafia and have a normal life, agreeing to do things knowing that if they don't, the Barrera brothers will torture or kill them and their families. How drugs make it past the border (and don't you think a wall is going to help with this!), how the American government looks the other way when it needs something and how the Mexican government pretends nothing is wrong because of the drug money kickbacks being handed over by the Barrera's for \"protection\".Corruption is ripe in this novel and it's almost disheartening. Even our protagonist, Art, has to make some sketchy decisions that move him from the right side towards the more morally gray area. Damn good book.

I can\u2019t remember the last time I read a book that was this broad based in scope, when dealing with the subject presented to the reader.THE POWER OF THE DOG is all about the war on drugs, primarily the Mexican cartel side of the war on drugs. Told from the perspectives of a DEA agent, a drug lord, a priest, a hooker and a Irish hitman, this story takes you through the entire web of drugs, from the meager beginnings of the DEA and it\u2019s war waged by then president Richard Nixon in the 1970\u2019s, to the days of the late 1990\u2019s and billions of dollars of cash flowing through an intricate web of deceit, betrayal, murder, kidnapping, governmental manipulation, the Mob and so much more! Looking at all of this on paper, it would be easy to think that this story, spanning the globe throughout three decades, might be convoluted, but it\u2019s actually not at all. Author Don Winslow masterfully tells a very deep and thorough story that gripped me in its mammoth jaws right from the first chapter. The way he takes real life scenarios, like NAFTA for example, and makes it a believable part of his fictional story, is nothing short of genius. This is like Breaking Bad, but broader and with a variety of drugs. Despite being undoubtedly one of the very best books I have read this year, if I had to be critical, the only real downside I could give to the book is that the characters are not deep. Some are better fleshed out than others, but certain characters I would have liked to have seen expanded upon a little further. Winslow doesn\u2019t always take a lot of time to let us get into the characters intricacies and deeper passions, and usually this would be a bigger issue with me and a book, but with the amount of superb storytelling on all other fronts of this book, I can actually look past this here. There might have been a few small lulls in the proceedings and action of the story, but never was I not on the edge of my seat during the books 542 pages.I\u2019m really surprised that I had never heard of this book until last week. With how good this book is, I would expect it to be on the lips and tongues of many people who enjoy crime books. Perhaps I just wasn\u2019t looking in the right places? I actually stumbled upon it by accident while searching for the new book to read. While looking around at books recently at Barnes and Noble, I saw a cover that caught my eye to a book entitled THE CARTEL. After reading the synopsis, I really wanted to read it and only then did I hear about THE POWER OF THE DOG, as it is the predecessor to THE CARTEL, so I bought it and boy am I ever glad I did. I can\u2019t stop here, now I MUST read THE CARTEL!If you like exceptionally dense books that weave a fictional story through real, true life happenings in our world, a story so expertly written and captivating that you\u2019ll wonder how the author could concoct such novel, then definitely check this out. I easily give this book my highest recommendation and a 5/5!", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2780059751", "review_id": "2780059751", "date": "Apr 15, 2019", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ethan", "user_url": "/user/show/5448340-ethan", "text": "There's something to be said about an author who takes the time to research their topic to such an extent that they are able to create a story that completely inhabits the world they researched. In the case of author Don Winslow, he's studied the intricacies of the drug trade on the Mexican border for over 20 years. Winslow has recently taken to Twitter as a vocal critic to President Trump's border control policies. Whatever your political persuasions, there is no denying that Winslow writes and speaks from a place of well-earned understanding and expertise. He may just write fiction, but he's lived in the worlds he writes about, studied the complex social and economic factors behind that world, and written some killer fiction in the process. The Power of the Dog is nothing short of a masterwork. Attempting to summarize the plot or characters would be an injustice to the narrative that Winslow has worked so diligently to present. Imagine the best elements of a police procedural wrapped up with the crime elements of Sicario or Narcos, and throw in a touch of The Godfather or The Sopranos for good measure. That is just barely scratching the surface of the scope of this novel. Despite the multiple decades covered, crimes committed, and the sheer amount of character lines running through the novel, it never feels confusing or overstuffed. The story flows effortlessly off the page, a true testament to Winslow's ability to present such an intricate world. At the heart of the novel lies Art Keller, a DEA agent who has worked the Mexico cartels for years. He is motivated to bring down the notorious cartel run by Adan Barrera. Interspersed amongst this main plot are the stories of a young prostitute, a priest, a Mexican cop, and some Irish mobsters. Each character is impacted either directly or indirectly by the drug culture or the fight against it. From the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, we see these characters advance through time and experiences that have inevitable physical, monetary, and emotional ramifications. It truly is an in-depth portrait of the cause and effect of the \"War on Drugs.\"For all the large set pieces and action, and Winslow spares no detail in his graphic and striking actions scenes, The Power of the Dog is ultimately an intimate character study and a conclusive referendum on the inner workings of both the drug trade and the fight to stop it. It is a true testament to Winslow's authorial prowess that the novel manages to cover such a large period of time and characters while still being the kind of thriller that you can't stop reading. Moreso, the depth of Winslow's research brings an authenticity that grounds this novel in a reality that is undeniable. Several times I had to remind myself that I was reading a work of fiction. The Power of the Dog is the first in a trilogy that includes The Cartel and this year's The Border. It reads as a complete work, but I can't wait to see where these characters go next.

The start is a bit rocky with a slow pace and a plot I wasn't sure I was going to fully commit to but the rocky gave way to the roll and this wound up being a really strong, solid book that I enjoyed. The best thing about this book is it's characters and their various moralities. You have the protagonist who essentially leaves his family behind to feed his obsession for justice and the way that sense of what is just and what isn't evolves as he falls deeper and deeper into his own mania. You have the antagonist who rides a fast and easy slope into money and power but unlike the man who chases him, his family is everything to him--as is love. He's the perfect contrast and the way these two men switch being the light and the dark, each informing the sense of justice and faith of the other is intricate and engaging.Then you have the cast of supporting characters. The humble priest, the reluctant gunman and the shrewd whore. Part of what makes this book rocky at it's beginning is the distance between these characters. They live in different corners of the world. They have wildly different experiences. But each of their worlds eventually collide and revolve around each other and the two main characters as they all devolve into chaos. The plot takes place over many years and it can be a bit jerky and disjointed at times. The transitions aren't always smooth and it takes some time to adjust. The pace at times is very slow but for the most part, it moves on at, if not a fast pace, at least a very steady one. There are places where it's easy to put this book down, but there are more places where you feel compelled to just read one more page, then another and another. It's an intense book. There isn't much in the way of levity or laughs and while it's not supposed to be funny by any means, what it is supposed to be is real. And real life, even life in dark places, in dark times with terrible people, there is levity and I felt this book could have used a few, well-placed, attempts at contrasting the onslaught of darkness. Sometimes, the way to emphasize the darkness is to show some light, it gives the grittiness depth.All in all, this is an easy one to recommend. It's really good. Don't let the beginning of it deter you. It's worth the set up when you get to the good stuff. 3.75 to 4 stars.", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/473590658", "review_id": "473590658", "date": "Dec 09, 2012", "rating": 5, "user_name": "B\u00fccherplanet", "user_url": "/user/show/15023416-b-cherplanet", "text": "F\u00fcnf Sterne sind zu wenig!

Man rast durch die Kapitel und muss anschlie\u00dfend \u00f6fters innehalten und Luft holen! Trotz aller Brutalit\u00e4t lebt dieses Buch auch von seinen hervorragend ausgearbeiteten Charakteren und den mit diesen Personen verbundenen Handlungsstr\u00e4ngen, die auf unglaubliche Art und Weise irgendwie alle zusammen laufen. Ich habe mich beim Lesen immer wieder gefragt, wie Winslow sich solch eine handlungsintensive Geschichte ausdenken konnte und dabei trotzdem nicht unglaubw\u00fcrdig wurde oder den Faden verlor. Jeder einzelne Handlungsstrang - und davon gibt es viele - f\u00fchrt letztlich zu einem gro\u00dfen Ganzen und gerade das macht am Ende den \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigenden Gesamteindruck des Buches aus.

Don Winslow has written a book of epic scope that deals with the drug trade in Mexico over a 30-year period.The cast of characters includes a Mexican family whose father establishes a drug operation and is later succeeded by his two sons; a prostitute; a rebel priest; a US DEA agent and a hit man. Starting in the early 70s, we see the Barrera family build a drug cartel that ultimately leads to their being the drug lords of Mexico. Starting as a local operation growing its own poppy plants, the Barreras eventually discover that there is more money to be had if they move cocaine from Colombia. Such power does not come without notice, and over the decades there are various operations and plots that attempt to knock them down. Along the way, there's conflict between the Latin American drug cartels, the US government and the Mob. Over the course of three decades, we follow the lead characters, all of whom are fully developed and emotionally complex. At different times, they all touch one another; at different times, good triumphs over evil or evil conquers good. There are no easy answers in the book. Winslow deals convincingly with the themes of power, love and corruption on a broad scale. My only gripe with the book is that the main characters are Teflon proof: they emerge from every battle relatively unscathed. This happened repeatedly throughout the book, which damaged its plausibility for me.THE POWER OF THE DOG was very good and likely to be touted as Winslow's masterpiece, but I prefer his standalones, such as THE DEATH AND LIFE OF BOBBY Z. That being said, the book is an amazing accomplishment with a complex narrative that is wide-ranging and fast-moving. It reminded me a bit of James Ellroy, but with more accessible writing. Winslow excels at presenting the narrative through multiple points of view in a wide variety of settings. The interconnections between the characters are always shifting.

The failure of the War of Drugs was also quite apparent. Which raises the question as to what we should be doing? Is liberalizing drugs the answer? I think not. Here is a summary from the novel:\"The War on Drugs. I've fought it my whole goddamn life, and for what? Billions of dollars, trying unsuccessfully to keep drugs out of the world's most porous boarder? One-tenth of the anti-drug budget going into education and treatment, nine-tenths of those billions going to interdiction? And not enough money from anywhere going into the root causes of the drug problem itself. And the billions spent keeping drug offenders locked up in prison, the cells now so crowded we have to give early release to murderers. Not to mention the fact that two-thirds of all the \"non-drug\" offenses in America are committed by people high on dope or alcohol. And our solutions are the same futile non-solutions - build more prisons, higher more police, spend more and more billions of dollars not curing the symptoms while we ignore the disease. Most people in my area who want to kick drugs can't afford to get into a treatment program unless they have blue-chip health insurance, which most of them don't. We're spending almost $2 billion poisoning cocaine crops and kids over here [Colombia], while there's no money at home to help someone who wants to get off drugs. It's insanity. Art can't decide whether the War on Drugs is an obscene absurdity or an absurd obscenity. In either case, it's a tragic bloody farce.\"I certainly could not say it any better than Winslow.

The Power of the Dog is not a bad book by any stretch of the imagination. Winslow has an ability to sketch out very cinematic set pieces. And his writing does not commit any major crimes against the English language (the low bar that I set for popular fiction). But Winslow's characters are one dimensional and colorless. Even worse, Winslow tries really hard to turn his characters into charismatic badasses...and fails miserably. For the protagonist Art, Winslow writes every sentence as if the character is auditioning for some campy nineties action flick. He often says such obvious and clich\u00e9d shit like \"This wasn\u2019t an arrest...it was an execution.\" Winslow also shamelessly abuses paragraph breaks in a vain attempt to make Art sound cooler, and ends up making him sound melodramatic and corny. For instance, when comparing Art's obsession with T\u00edo to alcoholism, Winslow writes,I'm like an alcoholic, Art thinks. He\u2019s heard reformed drunks talk about how they would drive to the liquor store, all the time swearing they weren\u2019t going to go, then go in swearing they weren\u2019t going to buy, then buy swearing they weren\u2019t going to drink the booze they\u2019d just bought. Then they\u2019d drink it.I\u2019m that guy, Art thinks, drawn toward T\u00edo like a drunk to the bottle.Everything wrong with Winslow's writing can be seen in these few paragraphs.

This book is its opposite, a sprawling, ambitious and impassioned novel about the War on Drugs and its abundant corruption and hypocrisies. It ranges from the 1970s to the 1990s and follows the criss-crossing paths of five main characters and a score or more of supporting players, but in the main it concerns the 20-year war between an obsessed DEA agent and two drug kingpin brothers, and Winslow's abundant research is obvious as he shows how the drug growers and smugglers work and how law enforcement tries (or sometimes tries not to) catch them. In places \"The Power of the Dog\" reminded me of James Ellroy and the way Ellroy uses particular characters to dramatize points he wants to make about America's delusions about its own history -- but without Ellroy's sometimes annoying writer's tics of alliteration for its own sake and rat-a-tat phrasing. It does have some weaknesses. The five main characters are pretty close to walking cliches: the lawman willing to bend the rules, the villian with a humanizing love for his family, the hooker with the heart of gold, the hitman yearning to get out, the priest who helps bolster others' faith as he doubts his own. Worse, one of the lower-level bad guys is into so much stuff -- he's in the CIA, the Mafia and at least two other organizations -- that he seems more of a plot convenience than an actual character. That said, I was compelled to keep reading, fascinated by the twists and turns of the unpredictable plot and by the power of Winslow's compelling vision of how often American diplomacy and South American drug-running have made a devil's bargain, to the detriment of all.

Boy, it did, and how! Put in a larger context, the Power of the Dog is a relentlessly brutal and belligerent fictional account of America\u2019s war on drugs. The central narrative is conceived around a cast of graphically developed characters - comprising DEA agents, drug-lords, mercenaries, hit-men, call-girls and priests - whose fates are irrevocably intertwined with that of one American agent's (Art Keller) obsessive-compulsive pursuit to put behind bars the kingpin of Mexican drug cartel (Adan Barrera). Played out over nearly four decades, the book motors along with incredible and graphic details of vicious savagery of drug cartel operations and the expeditious and vile nature of the political response against (and sometimes, in favour of) them. In my mind, the true achievement of Don Winslow, here, is not just in how vividly he portrays an engaging story on a relevant and persistent subject of the present era; rather, it is also, and particularly, in his ability to provoke the duality of every actor we encounter along the way and to question the very ethics of the response against organised crime.

This author did his research.This book is episodic. It starts in the mid-70s and follows the characters through to the 90s. Nothing is untouched from assassinations to aid to the Sandinistas to drug involvement with FARC, etc. It's also fast-paced. The last fourth of the book is a particular thrill ride.There is violence and some of it is uncomfortable, but it is brief and not exploitative. The violence serves a story-telling purpose. I had to take breaks at times due to the tension of what may happen next, not because of the violence.Highly recommended!", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["1st-in-series", "mexico", "political-novels"]}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1385502599", "review_id": "1385502599", "date": "May 27, 2018", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Sandy", "user_url": "/user/show/4593297-sandy", "text": "This is an absolutely masterful narrative that spans decades and continents in telling the story of America's War on Drugs and its ripple effects in Latin America. Winslow creates a variety of fascinating characters, each with their own backstories and complex sets of values and motivations, and does a great job of explaining how the narcotrafficker cartels of Latin America developed and evolved, at times with the unwitting (or, at times witting) assistance of the U.S. government, depending on its policy priorities at a given time. This book is obviously very well-researched, and Winslow does a nice job of keeping the different narrative arcs moving at the same time and bringing them together, often in unexpected, surprising or explosive ways. One quick word of advice: if graphic depictions of violence make you uncomfortable, this is NOT the book for you. This is an extremely violent book, and characters are often tortured and/or killed in stomach-wrenching ways. This book features one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever seen, from the development of the scheme to its grisly execution. Winslow really pulls no punches in depicting the sheer brutality of how the cartels handle their business, and if you'd prefer not to read the full details, I would not recommend this book for you. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the history of US-Latin American relations in the late 20th century and the rise of the drug trade on a massive, industrial scale, and I can't wait to read the sequel, \"The Cartel.\" ", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_id": "6464188-el-poder-del-perro", "book_title": "El poder del perro", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1742161714", "review_id": "1742161714", "date": "Oct 31, 2016", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Professor Weasel", "user_url": "/user/show/1257892-professor-weasel", "text": "Unfortunately, like the lamest fan ever, my main issue with this book is that it isn't as good as \"The Cartel\" (and how could it be? It was written first!). I found this book quite confusing--I had trouble keeping track of who was who, especially all the Irish and Italian gangsters (why did they have to go by like three different names that were used interchangeably? :(). Ultimately I think Winslow excels most when he is writing from a very moral place--about something he is clearly EXTREMELY passionate about, like the plight of journalists in \"The Cartel.\" In this book, I didn't find the Irish hitman, blonde escort, and the (sadly underdeveloped and under-used) liberal priest as compelling or gripping as the child sicario, blackmailed journalist, and female police officer in \"The Cartel.\" I also don't think Ad\u00e1n (the main narco guy, who clearly becomes El Chapo in book two) is as fully developed as he later becomes. But I suppose that's what's good about writing--you grow into it and hit your stride. The most interesting parts of this book for me were the scenes that traced the history of the War of the Drugs in America, and that in itself makes this worth reading.

Winslow is even telling us the Story of a failed state. Mexico is corrupt and the Connection between the narcos and the government is clear. Different cartels use different police units who are deeply corrupt. But it is not an idea to just \"build a wall to Mexico and make the Mexicans pay for it\" as a candidate for the US presidency has put it.The US with ist different wars on drugs and on communism and on terrorism has no conscience either.
